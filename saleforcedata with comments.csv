Ability to visualize the attached images in the HTML view,Pepita Lerus,Under Point Threshold,2040,15,Please fix.,None,Its absurd to even have to ask for this basic functionality. The current implementation causes so much lost time, and is a major cause of frustration for so many of our SFDC users. When an email comes in with embedded images, it slows us down enormously, which makes us look unresponsive, and unprofessional. Its just bad that it doesnt do this simple thing,This would be incredibly useful, and it seems counter intuative to do it a different way.,Agree with everyone else - could be a huge time saver ,Agree much needed feature.,This is a huge problem, since it leads to a lot of wasted time trying to pierce together what customers are trying to tell us. Please fix urgently!!,Please do act on this. I know you need a certain number of votes but this is critical to so many of us, thanks!,None,None,None,None,This goes for embedded screen images posted in the body of inbound emails too, pulling them out and adding a link to an attachment isn't user friendly in the slightest.  They should be seen in situ to help follow the email details. ,None,This is a definite requirement and should not have been overlooked for this long
Process Builder: Error messages,Bhawani Shankar Sharma,Product Team Review,12120,15,Good Idea!,"Just spent 30 minutes trying to debug another ""FlowApplication Error"" (process+flow updates the initial record and related records) and it turns out page layout field requirements can throw this error for related records - even if it's initilized via API. Would be really helpful and time efficient to have more context up front instead - even if it's just the erroring record Id.",LOB folks keep asking after this,I am running into this with a process I have right now.  I have an optional field that can initiate a process as long as another feld is also filled in but that field is also optional.  Instead of my validation rule catching the fact that the required field for the process isn't filled in, the process just fails and gives my users the generic message above.   Something as simple as a message box that could pop up and explain that the process cannot trigger becuase all the required elements are not present?  This is just like the issue with approval processes where a record might not meet all the requirements to enter an approval.  Why can't we have a way to tell our users what the issue is?  Please fix this!   I could do this with macros in MS Access in 1996.,This is much needed,we keep running into this error.,This only makes sense as part of the next evolution of this tool!,Having the process builder wait steps with record id show up in the Time-Based Workflow area of set up, that would be helpful. OR having the record id Paused and Waiting Interviews here would be helpful as well as on the detail record page for the flow interview wait step.,None,None,None,Customizable (helpful) error handling for the user would be great!,This is fairly useless, since it just identifies the flow but doesn't help at all in troubleshooting.  I've found that PB often trips when a validation rule fails on a record that is calling a PB flow.  For example,"  a record  passed a validation when it was created (and so PB functioned fine) but fails later because something on a related object has changed  - we don't care about the change until the record is actually edited.  So I've changed most validations to start with ""if changed"" ......   Then the record passes the validation and so PB works fine",None,@Elad Idan Nice approach!
Knowledge articles: Titles for empty fields should be hidden in customer portal,Deb Kuykendall,Under Point Threshold,1110,8,@Preston: Eric was talking about Salesforce help portal, not Salesforce Knowledge product.,This is still an issue with knowledge today and we would like to see blank entries removed for Knowledge articles when viewed in the customer portal, and when previewing articles.,+1000000000, Thanks.. yeah, it would be nice if it were taken care-of in the Knowledge App..,@Preston: Eric was talking about Salesforce help portal, not Salesforce Knowledge product.,I'm reviewing Knowledge in our evnrionment and I'm also not seeing where this has been implemented. Is there any plan in the next release in 2011?,Hello Eric,None
Report Filters Should Be Able To Compare Fields To Each Other,jeffrey rheel,Under Consideration,37400,16,None,I think this request is a no-brainer... I was pretty surprised to see that it was not already an option. Please consider!,This would be a great feature & would cut down on time discovering work-arounds to achieve similar results.,A very useful feature and a must have!,I need this yesterday ,Must have!,Much needed.  I'm trying to find opps where the Closed Date is creater than the Last Stage Change Date for Lost opps.  I am not an Admin and don't have the ability to create custom fields or formulas.,I'm doing the jig again, trying to compare two fields... so glad to see this is officially on the product roadmap.,None,None,This is crucial for functionality that compares if values match up. Making a checkbox formula for every condition you need that compares functions is not useful for users that do not have access to that permission. This also adds to your field limit on that specific object. A use case is where you compare if the sales team is meeting their goal. You can isolate key demographics and trends to help facilitate leads to meet deadlines and required goals. Without quick filters that can compare field values to other field values, a normal user cannot create a report to extrapolate this key data.,None,None,This is such a basic CRM/Database functionality it seems a joke that it's not available in SFDC,Surely this is basic functionality and a must have.,This basic report functionality was asked for 8 years ago and still no solution???? Borders on the ridiculous.
Wave Analytics - Report Filter Logic (using And & OR),Chris Rustici,Under Point Threshold,790,6,Why is this functionality missing?? This is absolutely critical.,This functionality is standard in Salesforce reporting. It is equally important in Wave. Some of my dashboards contain data references with an asterisk because we do not have this OR functioanlity. Please add this to Wave!!!!,This seems like a basic requirement for any reporting/analytics engine,Currently this can only be done with SAQL.  We REALLY need this feature.,This is a big dealbreaker! We need this functionality ASAP.,I am building my first lens and was surprised that this was not available.
Increase Maximum length of the SOQL query in the Query field of a PushTopic,Dennis Eckert,Under Point Threshold,200,1,None
Bulkify Process Builder - Part 2,Virginia Leandro,Under Point Threshold,1580,11,Good idea.,A very good Idea, much needed,Process Builder is a powerful tool and absolutely needs to be bulkified if the customers have to use it efficiently.,Sounds like a good idea.,This issue is not resolved yet as I am hitting Apex CPU Limit error when more than 10 process flows on a object get executed sequentially for each record (If there are 50 records, it gets executed 50 times).,Much needed. Would not call Process builder bulkified without this.,We have a reasonably large Process that regularly hits 84 of 100 SOQL Queries and errors out at over 100 SOQL Queries  about 1 out 5 times that it is run.,None,None,Much needed functionality.  When we are trying to udpate the Contact record field info based on Account field info, we are also receiving PB error if an account has more than 100 contacts.  The PB upate is firing other triggers and all before/after update actions on the contact object which results to the org limits error.  Please bulkify PB process accordingly.  Thank you.,Badly needed. Until then PB Flows are only partially useful and cannot really replace the programming needs for triggers.
Permission Sets with Page Layout Assignment,Simon Baird,Under Point Threshold,2470,15,This feature would be really helpful.,I would also like to see the ability to somehow assign page layouts via a permission set; however, in the case of a user having multiple permission sets with different page layouts assigned to the same record type, there would need to be a way to determine which one wins.,This would be a really helpful feature. ,So much YES on this one. When I inherited this org there were at least a dozen profiles. I've cleaned house as much as I could, but I really need the page layout assignment on the permission sets to get the best results. ,We have a need to change a Case Page Layout for one User without affecting other Users on the same Profile. A Permission Set would be the perfect way to accomplish this.,Much Needed for Users that may Span 2 Profiles especially Home Page Layouts,Having this feature is going to help lot in designing more complex applications with custom visibility requiremnts.,Such a pain to set up particular users with access without having the page layout set in the permissions...can we get this soon?,It would be great if you could override a profile's page layout assignment using a permission set. Often you need granular control over what types of layouts are assigned and this would be a great addition to the current permission sets.,This is a feature that is sorely needed. Microsoft Dynamics: CRM has had the ability to allow users to chose between page layouts for years now. ,Excellent idea!,We use Permission Sets extensively - this is really needed!,Same as others have posted.  Would love to eliminate profiles and page layouts by using Permission Sets. ,sooo annoying .. ,This is needed!! 
Schedule Reports as Attachments and add Adobe PDF, Excel Option,Pat Buchanan,In Development,47980,16,None,I've started to use this feature for users and had made the assumption that as well as being in the body of the email it would also include an Excel attachment; I'm truly surprised we do not have this basic feature available.,It would be nice to choose Excel or PDF.  Please consider this suggestion.,Very much needed function.,very much needed,We really need this functionality. When will it be available?,Yes we need this, any updates ?,Is there an update on this idea?,Looks like Kristie is no longer with Salesforce.  Wonder where we go now to get an update on this.,None,OMGosh! ,None,I also thinking adding criteria to the scheduler would be helpful too.  So that if you have a custom report created already that you can put in the criteria (IE specific contact = ??? and Date time frame = ??? ) without having to create a bunch of seperate reports.  So when you have like Top 10 partner contacts.  You can send opportunites recieved from them in a set period of time to say thanks, but only their data goes to them. ,None,Hi Kristie, Its been a year there is no update on this idea. Any easy solution on this Idea?,"Agree with Richard.  One vague update a year ago does not instill a sense of confidence.  If this was on the ""roadmap"" 1 year ago"," I would hope that timing has been clarified a bit since then.  I would also be interested in details regarding the planned enhancement - will scheduled reports be PDF or Excel format?  How about CSV or ""Printer Friendly"" versions? "
Configurable default list view in Lightning Experience,Derek Hans,Product Team Review,2640,15,I would like to be able to set my account and contacts view defaults to my accounts and my contacts,Second John's comment!,This is so annoying, particularly on cases. We always want 'open cases' rather than recently viewed. It wastes a lot of time during the day.,I know it's only an extra click for the users, but multiple users have complained.  Thanks!,I'd hate to calculate how much wasted time is spent by everyone having to click to change the view to whatever default we would prefer to see every single time we load a new object, and waiting for the new list to load. Couldn't believe it when I found this page and realised setting a default view wasn't possible!,Hugely frustrating something seemingly so simple is no implemented.,This is so important for getting user buy-in if there are unnecessary steps and clicks required who is going to bother?!  ,Add it to Classic while you are at it.,Very annoying to have recently viewed defaulted. +1,Ditto... all of the comments.,Yes, make it so!,Seriously?  You can't set a default list view?? C'mon guys.,yes please. productivitiy is the goal of lightning and this means so many more clicks. ,Please add this functionality to Lightning!,Yes! Users find this so confusing!
"Opportunity tab: Display ""Account Name"" within ""Activity History""",Steel Works Rebar Fabricators,Under Point Threshold,230,2,This is requested by many users.,Highly useful....not just for opportunities but for viewing activities related to campaign members on the activity list views.
Tracking consent as required by the General Data Protection Regulation,Paul Morriss,Under Point Threshold,670,12,ALSO DELETING OF USERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN SALESFORCE.COM to make it GDPR consistent.,None,This is necessary in basic CRM to comply with Personal Data permission regulations and best practices. Admins will be developing their own solutions to this unless Salesforce or a Partner build scalable eloquent enterprise solutions .,None,Agreed on the idea. Global companies are going to need to become very familiar with this process as it will probably look similar around the world in different flavors over the years. Would be awesome if there was a native feature in Salesforce that tracked consent for different things.,I would really like to see some guidance from SF on this topic.  I am concerned what will happen if a contact is removed from our database and then one of our sales reps finds out about a contact and adds them back.  How will the system keep us compliant?,Ditto. Will be working on this topic at a client and some guidance from Salesforce would be really helpful.,None,We have an application built on the force.com platform, and operate globally.  All of our clients that are UK based are begining to ask for information as to how SF is planning to respond to GDPR.,This is now more and more on the question list of the customers.,Because this has very important legal implications I think Salesforce should help us by providing implementation approaches and/or tools.,We're starting to see more and more questions around this from the field.  Would be great for Salesforce to have a Whitepaper or something as it relates to how they support GDPR or how they plan to support it.  
Workflow email alerts to contacts should be recordable as activity history,AASF Director,Under Consideration,32580,16,None,Any update on this...?,Agreed - update on this would be helpful.  Can we expect this in the next release?,9 years and still waiting...,An update on this one would be great :),Can you please let us know when this going to be done? We need it as soon as possible!,It's time.,Can you post an update on the status of this?  Last one was 2 years ago...  Is it still under consideration?,Any Update from SF on addressing this issue?  Perhaps status update?,None,Need this for more than just Contacts.  Cases for instance, being able to track what emails were sent related to a case, even if sent through automation, is critical.,None,bummed out too,I have to say it is dissapointing how ofter I search for a solution and find exactly the same situation.  An idea with a ton of points, and an update from Salesforce that's two years old.  I love Salesforce, I really do, but how often this happens is a bummer. ,None,We have an IT Service Management tool called Remedyforce.  Our customers who use Remedyforce on Salesforce run into the same problems or similar problems in that when they use Workflows or Process Builder to send notifications, there's not a way to capture that those emails were indeed sent and associate those emails to our custom object.  We don't use Salesforce Activities or Salesforce Tasks; so it would be great to have the option to also capture the record of email being sent to a custom object.
Include Approval Submitted By or Approval Submitter as Notification Recipient,Donovan Kruger,Under Point Threshold,1200,15,None,Was this idea submitted 9 years ago or 4 years ago? Either way, too long for what majority of commenters have said is basic functionality. Why is it so difficult to implement? Please @Salesforce - is there a workaround in the meantime? ,For Knowledge Articles we have multiple steps in the approval process.  Basically someone writes an article, then it goes for approval from a Tech Review, and then goes to approval from a Copy Review.  We would like to be able to send an email notification to the person that submitted the approval if it is approved or rejected.,I just ran into this myself. Is there another option to accomplish this? Process Builder option ?,Very basic functionality which is not there as standard.,this should be standard.  the submitter is not always the record owner, and while you can use flows or process builder, it should not be needed.  submitter is pretty fundamental role to approval process!,I can hardly think of anyone who would more want an approval notice than the actual submitter. I can build a workaround," but that's just a hassle and more ""moving parts"" that can malfunction.",This should be supported in a standard way,It does not make sense the fact that the oringal submitter cannot be notify in a declarative way. I am aware of the workaround but this should be supported with less clicks.,None,Are you kidding me... you can't send an approval or reject email alert to the original person requesting the approval... not without a workaround..... amazing.... ,This really should be available,This is needed.,Im kinda shocked that this is not an option. Such a no brainer.,Setting up my first approval process has proven much more difficult than I originally thought. Each step of the way I find another limitation and now this. Why is it not a standard feature for the Approval Submitter to receive a notification? Please add this feature as in our Org the opportunity owner is not always the person who submits for approval.
Related List Sorting - More than one choice,AEI Admin,Under Consideration,42530,16,All, this is still on our radar, but no concrete timeframe yet. We will continue to update this idea as more information becomes available.   ,This request is 9 years old. Of feature requests that haven't already been delivered," it is the 4th highest scoring. The three with higher scores are either ""partially delivered"" or ""under development."" Yet this one -- which can't possibly be all that difficult as these things go -- is merely ""under consideration."" It's simply astonishing that this would linger so badly.",This is definitely needed.  We're failry new to Salesforce and would greatly benefit out Teams.  Example is on the Accounting page, sorting the related contacts list first by inactive status (so active shows at top) and then alpha by contact name.,Kirill Yunussov - I would laugh if it wasn't so true and sad. THe black hole of Idea Exchange :(,Well this idea is only 9 years old.  Maybe in another 9 it will get here.,We need this functionality for both Listviews and Tabular Reports,Cannot believe this is still not been acted on.,It's also nice if you can sort dates desc nulls first,One of the most missing feature not only for related list but also for list views as well !!! ,This is a biggie for us.  We present reports to our customers and need to be able to more finely control the sorting of these reports.,As a salesperson trying to manage my activity using Salesforce, this would help me prioritize more effectively.,So many reasons why this would be a good idea, including being able to present the data users want to see using native SF UI rather than having to use custom overlays and VF. ,None,Yes, please! Especially with the new Shared Contacts feature. It would be much easier to review a company contact list if the Contact Related List on the Account could be sorted by say, Active/Inactive Contacts, then by Direct/Indirect contacts, then alpha by Contact Name. Please push to make this happen!!,This is sorely needed to make reports more useful.,None
Last Activity Date is not logically correct - please fix,Richard Massey,Under Point Threshold,1960,15,None,I've just run into the same issue.  We are trying to establish what customers haven't had any contact recently so ran an account report with Last Activity Date.  One example shows the Last Activity Date on the account as 24th Sept 2015, when in fact there are a further 15 calls and emails logged (linked to contacts and opportunities) up to August 2016.  This is very misleading.,Hi Mary, Happy to hear that we were able to get your rollups working for this!,None,None,I never even noticed this before.  This does seem logically flawed to me.,Crazy that this is still open," if the field can't be modified atleast create another one that delivers the ""true"" value of last activity.",Last Activity is flawed and it needs correction.,Fix this please!,Please add this!,None,It seems the current error is that activities with multiple attendees aren't counted. What a fail!,None,Any closure on this? ,None
Process Builder: created and last modified information,Johan Yu,Product Team Review,2720,15,Easy to spot the person created.,Very much advantageous!,Very helpful!,The Flow option w Workbench is fine but this would definitely be helpful on the Admin UI for auditing purposes. We love Process Builder, but this seems like it would be standard. ,None,Please make this available in the admin UI.  Essential for auditing purposes.,yes plzzzz,Much needed feature request for colaborative dev teams.,I love process builder and sure would like to see some audit inforamtion on them. Please add and I'll buy ice cream. ,OH yeah -- Please help us to avoid jumping through hoops for this. Not that I'm complaining: Process Builder is GREAT!!,Would be very helpful,Yes, please - it's a massive hassle to track this info down; it should be available right in the UI.,Yes, especially since the Last Modified User is the user is the one who receives the error emails when the Processes fail.,None,Process builder - such a powerful feature for admins but missing the most basic info. Workbench gives those details but good to have those details in the process builder UI as well.
Alter Org-Wide emails and Additional Emails (on email alerts) on copy to sandbox,Kevin Shuk,Under Point Threshold,690,4,You're kidding me that this isn't done.  We need contact emails masked too!  WFR don't just go to users - as above there is the additional email box and related contacts.,Yes, we REALLY need this. many of our org-wide emails are tied to Email to case and these test emails end up in production. Would be great if these emails got updated as part of the sandbox refresh as well.,None,None
Roll-Up Summary Fields: Formulas Rather than Static Criteria,Chris Thompson,Under Consideration,25200,16,None,Any update from Salesforce on this one?  It's so frustrating,Oh, this is frustrating! The relative date is so necessary for rollups :(,Yes, please, please, please, please...,Totally agree!!! ,You can do this with Rollup Helper, also free on the AppExchange: http://goo.gl/63oEEq,Please can we have an update on the status of this?  Would be good to know if this is actually on the roadmap.,Darn.. Just tried to add the following in my rollup Date__c >= TODAY.. Bummer! ,Come on, Salesforce, listen to your customers!  How many more votes does an idea need before it gets onto the roadmap?  The lack of this functionality is causing us real issues.,None,This would be so helpful in a number of scenarios.,I'm trying to roll up based on picklist values, but the number of values I need to include exceeds the field limit and you can't use OR to add the additional values.  Only AND is supported.  At the very least, this should be fixed.,Wanting this :),None,@Kristie Garafola, what is the update today?  Your comment above is form a year ago.  This idea now has 22,570 Points, 2,271 Votes from 12 Merged Ideas.  I understand that it may not be a priority to SFDC, but it seems to be a prioroty for many of your users.  ;-),+1 Salesforce and it's incredible agility ... WAHOU !
Respond to PackageUploadRequest from Tooling API upon request submission,Brian Triplett,Under Point Threshold,190,0
List View Controls for Tasks tab in LEX,Radek Salomon,Under Point Threshold,2430,15,The transperent overview of all activities in the business is key to us and critical for our business.. I'd like to see this in Lightning as soon as possible.,Sorry... 2550 POINTS if merged with https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000LjQPAA0,This is at 2550 votes if merged with https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000LjQPAA0,Please don't make this another reason NOT to use Lightning Experience. Let's get this in the Summer release!,We use tasks for post sales support and follow-up.  Hard enough to get people to adopt task workflows without thowing view limitations into the mix.,Another use case: I want to sort my call list for the day by time zone.,Must have.  Please add.  Just rolled out Lightning to 250 users and this request comes up all the time.,None,Would be e graet aid to have !,A must have, essential to be able to plan your task better.,We realy need this,This is one of the feature parity gaps that keeps us from making the switch to Lightning. I've already got a lightning version of our sales app created, customized the lightning pages, and am just waiting for little annoyances such as the Tasks tab to slowly get to a place where they are helpful and not a hinderance.,Totally need this functionality. The current task list view doesnt cut it! Our sales team need to plan their schedule to the future, not just seeing today's task.,Would be very useful.,None
Allow more than 4 fields in Lightning Compact Layout,Rich Spitz,Under Point Threshold,350,4,None,4 fields is ok for mobile, waste of space on a desktop view. please add the ability for more fields,None,I just thought of a fourth option. I would be good with some kind of Autofit,"where the fields could be ""squeezed"" together like when you double click on columns in Excel."
Show Contact Role in Opportunities Related List,Charles Goss,Under Point Threshold,2310,15,This is quite frustrating. I love the new Tribute fields, but when I look at the opportunity list on a contact I can't tell that the donation was actually a honoree or tribute notification.,customizatoin of this would be most appreciated since it will be more easy to keep track of contact data in one place.,This would be very helpful.  In addition, it would be nice if the contact roles related list was customizable.  We have sales people who cover multiple time zones.   They would like to see which time zone a customer is in by looking at the related list.  Having to go back to the contact object is time consuming.,None,How is this still a thing? At first, I thought it was maybe because 1 contact could have multiple roles on the opportunity and the related list couldn't handle this. But now I see that if I add 1 contact with multiple roles, multiple entries show up in the related list. This has been around for years and they haven't bothered to address this? I'm still required to click on the link, scroll down to the related list, and then find the user I'm looking for in order to determine the role? That's utterly absurd.,Please!,Agree.   Having the role visible will help user understand the depth of the contacts associated to the Opportunity...especially useful to assisting with optimization of marketing automation.,Please upvote this idea to fix this glaring oversight, thanks,This feature is really critical - the opportunity roles are far less valubale when you can't see them on a contact page. It reduces the value of that feature immensely.,Also be able to see a Contact's Title (or other custom fields) would be helpful.,Client needs this as well.,+1,This would be a most useful addition for our NFP organisation. Seems no-one is listening though.,Even simple soft/hard check box would be helpful to let users know without drilling down.,This information is essential for our fundraisers to know at a glance.  It would be extremely helpful to have the ability to add these two fields to the related list layout.
Workflow email alerts to the Contact Roles on an Opportunity,Kimberly Prescott,Product Team Review,5340,15,This is a very common use case,Waiting for many years to get this. Still in REVIEW? :(,This is a much meeded functionality. Need to be implemented.,I really need this functionality,  we need to send an email acknowledgment notification to contact when an opportunity got created in salesforce. ,Should be delivered years ago! Must have! ,None,Email alert to a primary contact role would be ideal!,The same applies to all contact roles on a Contract. Basically, wherever a many-to-many relationship is allowed, it is necessary to allow email alerts to all related contacts.,We need this as well.,this feature would improve our external commuication and provide better service for our clients. ,I also second another comment about having more roles than just primary and user!,This would be so perfect.,None,Email alert, field update, outbound messages, tasks, whatever - workflow or process builder - whatever it takes. This functinality is critically needed.,This idea has been getting a lot of votes for some time. It seems simple to be able to communicate with everyone involved with an opportunity without having to enter the contacts individually. Are you doing anything about it?
Process Builder - filter logic in Updating Records action,Johan Yu,Under Point Threshold,2260,15,This seems like a massive oversight. I assumed I was missing something obvious when I couldn't find an option to add the required logic. In my scenario I want to be able to add Field 1 and (Field 2 or Field 3).,None,Can't believe it's not there yet...,It would help tremendously and ensure that we are only updating fields that need updating and not all fields as is current.  I suspect it would help with the number of api calls too.,Yes. ,I want to add filter logic so I can use OR conditions,I cannot believe filter logic is not included in process builder!,This indeed will be helpful in reducing no. of action.,This will definitely help in reducing the number of steps and reduce the complexity of a complex PB.,This would cut way down on the number of steps and Actions in my Processes!,None,Need this - would reduce immediate actions from 37 to 14,The feature will be helpful,None,Need this in flow as well!
Make Joined Reports Available in Lightning,Brittany Dunbar,Under Point Threshold,1070,15,Come on Salesforce - this is requested more than 5 months back. It's basic functionality in the Classic version, which makes it now difficult to transfer to Lightning as 'above average'-reports are not possible in Lightning. Please - a big Thumbs Up for this idea ! ,We use several joined reports in Classic and are hesitating moving to Lightning.,Please add joined reports to Lightning, this will save the users from keep switiching between Classic and Lightning,None,Please bring this to Lightning,Please bring joined reports to Lightning,This is an essential feature for our businesses' day-to-day tasks and needs to be available in Lightning as soon as possible.,This is the only reason we cannot move to Lightning.  ,Lack of Joined Reports support in Lightning is keeping us from migrating to Lightning.  It is a major gap in Lightning Dashboards.,Please add this feature to Lightning,None,Please bring this to Lightning!,At least make Salesforce switch back to classic only for Joined reports,Just came across this one - and yes need a workaround ,this is killing us - please please fix.
Dedicate a year to upvoted customer ideas that devs actually implement(Devforce),Matthew Kozak,Product Team Review,6680,15,None,None,None,None,None,None,Totally agree. Thanks for posting the article Bill.,None,None,None,None,None,Excellent idea Matthew! It is amazing how often I know before I even search that an issue which has taken me 8 hours to code around has been sitting on the ideas board for years. This platform can be real flashy from a c-level demo standpoint (assuming they can see it correctly on the projector without the colors being washed out) , but when you get under the hood... hmmm there's some major work to be done.  My guess is that part has been left out of the ROI slide. :),None,None
Dependent page layouts - data rules to show, hide, or make fields/sections req'd,Orsolya Mate,In Development,72060,16,None,Are there any plans to have this available in Classic?,None,None,I was actualy told that this was a feature included with Salesforce and it really plays a vital role in our process.  We work with multiple customer types and the information required for these different customer types differs drastically.  So much so that most data collected for a lead or account is completely irrelevant to other lead or account types.  I need specific fields and sections to populate based upon certain peramiters input further up the lead or account info page.  Even Zoho can do this for less than half the price but I have to admit Salesforce is much easier to use.  I am pretty disappointed after signing up today, starting all my customizations and getting to this crutial step and finding out it cannot be done as promised.......,This is exactly what we are looking for as well. Hopefully, it will get implemented soon. It will allow us to further streamline our business process.,Would love to hear any updates on this!!!,None,Status: In development---  When is the release date?,Oops, @ABrickWall (among other frustrated typos),None,Looks like @KristieGarafola is no longer with the Force. To whom shall I tweet a desperate plea for this feature??,Yes, this would defintiely be helpful in the next edition of SalesForce!,This would be great and needed ASAP!! Really hope it's done in 2017.,Hopefully this is available soon!,We would like this in classic as well.
Add a new Standard field type: Address,Andres Gluecksmann,In Development,26120,16,"Update from the product team: ""This is  our next major project after Global Picklists.We have more picklist work to do and also some backend scalability work.We probably won't start on Address fields until the Winter  release (safe harbor).""",None,It is available for standard fields then it should also be available for custom fields. ,None,None,It is very usefu and we need this ASAP.,It will be an awesome feature to have.,Awesome, looking forward to it.,Yes, very useful!!,Very useful !,This would be very useful.,Very useful !,None,This would be very useful.,This would be outstanding to have,If this isn't incredibly simple to fix, it can only be because it was implemented poorly in standard fields in the first place. This isn't even new functionality, it's just a formatted data type that already exists and is already pervasive in everyone's implementation assuming they use accounts to any degree.

Updates to Salesforce Global Search,Nick Verhaeghe,Under Point Threshold,90,1,None
Lightning Experience - Multi User calendar,Johan Yu,Product Team Review,6060,16,We're definitely looking at how to solve this.  Collaboration is key.   I don't have a timeline yet.  But we're actively discussing options to support team/group calendars.,Must have. ,None,A necessity for our business operations. ,None,Any closer to getting this?,None,Any updates?,This would make sense to support collaboration,Any updates please?,I can't believe how many features from the current salesforce have not yet made it into Lightning. Any updates on this feature?,A shared calendar is a must for our organization - we will be waiting for this feature. ,Kayvaan... Any update on timeline for this? This will be a huge adoption issue for us on FSC.,None,None,None

Roll up display of Notes and Attachments in Lightning as it was in Classic,Keri-An Richards,Under Point Threshold,1670,15,This is causing user confusion and is causing problems in migrating to lightning experience.,This functionality is really important. Without the visibility of files at the Account level, we lose a lot of contexts and can't easily find data we are looking for. Please fix!,ROLL IT UP! We count on this functionality for everything we do.,Roll it up.  I can't understand why this was a standard function and not continued in Lightning.  As another poster stated, this an imperative process for our sales team and case management within the company.,I agree with this idea whole heartedly,Roll it up... ,Roll it up.. or at least give admins the ability to allow or not allow.  Thanks,Roll it up.. or at least give admins the ability to allow or not allow. ,I am dumbfounded as to why this decision was made.  Please roll docs up to their Account object!,How can we explain to our users that from now on because we choose to switch to lightninig, they won't find their files as easily as before?,This is a BIG MISS in Lightning. Managing a sales team that utilizes regular reporting that is uploaded into SF.com is an essential part of my job. Not having that ability to see all of that reporting under the Account record is going to significantly increase the amount of time I'm hunting for documents and reduce effeciency.,My department uses this feature on a daily basis and is critical to how we do our work.  Please make this change!!!,plase make this change, becaus it`s important fo us and our daily work,Please add support for this.  Having Notes and Attachments roll up to the Account level is critical to our daily case management processes.,Please add support for this. This is critical to our case management processes. 
Search body of email,Brian McCaughey,Under Point Threshold,1640,15,None,this is needed immediately...pls advise on work around.,Sad that this is an 8 year old idea... ,None,as,None,@Roxanne. Wish we could help, however we need clients to be running Enterprise or Unlimited / Performamce edition to get Kona up and running. I still think Cirrus would be worth exploring.,Does anyone have any recommendations for an application that does this now that will work with professional edition? ,Email-heavy customer support model.  Have received this request from many of our SF agents.,This would help us out a lot.,Great idea!,There are a number of search apps on the AppExchange that index any and all attached content, including the bodies of emails (as Kona we're one of them). Not sure if this is an option for you...,There are so many times I have tried to search SF to find a form or something, and it seems to only search the fields we've entered and the subject, but it doesn't search the body of the email.  I've had to have client's resend information, then it links to the closed case, but it would be oh so helpful to be able to search content in the body of the email and attachment names if possible.,A million times yes!! Please get this to the top of the list!,None
Emailing scheduled reports to Other email addresses - NON users,Synapse Admin,Under Consideration,15840,16,At this time this functionality is not on the immediate roadmap, but it is being considered for a future release. We will provide additional information as it becomes available. In the meantime, a number of people have posted potential partner solutions that could help. ,This is a basic business requirement; having to work around this is tedious, at best.  It's OUR data, we should be able to send it where-ever, when-ever needed!,None,Have to agree with everyone on this thread.  The request is now 8 year old with many votes and we still don't have this fucjtionality.  Although there are tools out ther to make this a possibility, I would much rather manage report scheduling for those not on the platform from withing the platform.  Please make this functionality available Salesforce.,None,None,None,None,None,My org is also looking for sth like that. Hope it implement soon !!!,My org is also looking for sth like that. Hope it implement soon !!!,This would be a tremendous help to us. ,None,I agree, this is needed.  I don't need everyone in Salesforce but email, whether reports or alerts, would be a way to increase the value of Salesforce within our organization,,None,For an organization with a lot of partners, the ability to schedule reports to send them is a must have.  Surprised this hasn't yet been tackled as a much-needed SF feature.  
Allow Task(s) to be assigned to a Queue,Niels Tissing,In Development,30330,16,None,This is a constant pain point and causes us a lot of admin time!,This would be great to have!,Yes, this is a problem for our teams as well.  We have different apps we've built on our platform.  Unless a Task has a related account, people can't see each other's tasks.  Have a queue solve this problem for us.,This would be hugely helpful and is needed for any collaborative/team ownership of tasks. When tasks need to be done as quickly as possible by the next staff member with capacity  - assigning tasks to a queue would greatly help with work flow.,I'm on board, let's make this happen,what Gary Grant said +1,This is a huge pain - forces the use of klunky custom objects and a disjointed UI experiences. It's a fundamental flaw in the whole concept of Tasks that make them mostly useless for team based business processes.,This would be a huge help since we are a support team and when a request comes in I want to give my people the chance to grab the ones they can.,This would simplify our biggest headache. Currently we have a task go to a manager every time a new application is completed and they then have to reassign it to the members of their team that are in the office that day to start working on it. Being able to eliminate the middle man work would improve effiency.,None,It would be wonderful to be able to add tasks to queues. We are working on an implementation that needs this. In the meantime we are having to build a work around. Please do this soon!,None,This feature not being available is frustrating. Can't afford to have tasks being assigned to an individual and not known to the entire team. ,nearly 30,000 points and not a priority? this should have been implemented years ago, move it up in priority! tasks need to be able to be assigned to queues or groups,With Pardot wired into our org, necessary tasks that Pardot would normally create cannot be pushed into salesforce if the owner of the Lead record is a queue.  Administratively we manually have to move ownership of queue-owned Leads to a person, let Pardot create the tasks, and then move ownership back to the proper queue.  Not a great use of administrator time for something that has been asked for by the community for over 6 years.  It's meat and potatoes kind of work, not the sexy lightning stuff that everyone goes gaga over, but someone still has to do this stuff to keep the train on the tracks.  Help us out, please.
"Restrict ability of users to ""Reassign"" Approval Process Requests",Ross Gilbert,Under Point Threshold,2040,15,Please Please please implement this! Thanks!,None,You should be able to restrict this natively! ,We need this,None,This should be restricted or removed as an option.,Seriously, I cannot believe this doesn't have more votes.  We need to be able to restrict this natively.,This is needed.  May be some kind of customization to choose the button for Approve/Reject and Reassingment.,I'm surprised this doesn't have more votes. I have a very unhappy client right now because some approvals are not properly updating, causing trigger failures and significant downstream business disruption. In the least, a re-assign should pass permissions to any related records to the new assignee, but it would be far better to just allow this to be switched off.,Should be configurable per approval process, and should be able to take into account a public group, permission set, or profile that is always allowed to reassign to enable a privileged user to help move along an approval processes that is 'stuck'.,Seems like a no-brainer for all the reasons others have mentioned.,None,Please,Please can we have this feature on the product roadmap ASAP considering it at least 3 years old request. Cheers!,This is a necessary function.
Sales Path: Closed Tab(s),Andrew Davidson,Under Point Threshold,240,4,None,This would make Path work for us. Right now we click Closed, choose Lost, get the validation error to fill out Loss Reason, then have to go back and update the Stage to Lost again THEN the Key Fields show up.,I agree,None
"""Insufficient Privileges"" error in LEX instead of ""Looks like there's a problem""",Fabio Andree Scheurel,Under Point Threshold,60,1,None
Ability to customize the columns in the Items to Approve section on home page,Peter Zhang,Product Team Review,7580,16,None,This view should allow for column customizations like every other OOB related list,The ability to add more information when approaching approvals would be fantastic!,None,We reached a point where we had to do something so we created an application to solve this problem internally called RapidApproval.  We have 50 internal users using the tool every day for all manner of workflow approvals.   It is a single page application that displays the items in the approval queue down the left, with the details of each item showing on the right.  We made it configurable to show identifying fields in the queue making it easier to see what's waiting.  We've been using this tool internally for several months and just published it to the AppExchange to help other folks over the same issues.   ,None,Our users cannot adide an uncustomizable Items to Approve section.,Please add this functionality as bussiness request it more and more,Thanks for this. But we should also be able to customize the OOB Home Page component.  Please act on it too.,None,Anyone reading this, if you have some visual force code that I can use to try and build this that would be awesome. Not really finding anything online but I'll continue the search. Thanks,Wish I could upvote this 20 times. It's crazy how horrible the view is for such an important function. I get that there are many types of objects that need approval so it's hard to allow all the different fields you need but there has to be a better way somehow. Even just a way to see which objects need to be approved and how many per object and a drop down to show you object specific lists that can be customized.,Much needed functionality!,Ditto other comments.  This should not require a Visualforce page.  Too logical, needs to be OOB,How is this not a thing yet? Nine years and 7,120 points....,"This is a standard ""out of box"" item and should include the ability to define our colums just like all other related lists or views. We need to be able to customize this out of box", without requiring visualforce. 
Ability to report on Users' Permission Set Assignments,Sonya Le,Under Consideration,15030,16,Thanks Krysta!!!,please allow to reporting assigned users with the permission set. very usefully. ,Please add this! ,Absolutley needed! Please push this!,This would be extremely useful for our compliance group.,Apparently in this long list of comments a few people have commented that there is work around or other messy solutions. So salesforce has decided that those answers are sufficient and are not working on this at all. The guy attached to this idea suggestion 'Adam Torman' doesn't even do the same job he did 4 years ago and is not following this thread at all,Working in a sandbox environment with some new apps and using permission sets.... working with a partner who is also making changes so its hard to keep track of users and permission sets they have.  Being able to report on or use data loader would be a huge time saver!,Last comment from @Adam Torman was 4 years ago. For real? Why is this not in already? If we can report on Profile, and Role, why not something that's essentially a Related List item?,Please add this ability to report,This would really beneficial for us. What are SF's plans to implement this? ,Please implement this feature,None,We needed this report.,Agree! We also need to be able to report on this for Audit reasons/reports. Would be huge for us!,I need it now!  And I agree it's a must for Audit reasons as well.,After years of many, many people asking for this feature the only thing we see from salesforce is 'Under Consideration' and a comment from over 4 years ago. How is it remotely possible that with all the poeple asking for this feature and the companies that get audited and use Salesforce that this has not beem implemented? I've read the excuse on the blog where they say this is a daunting task but that just sounds like an excuse for not listening to your customers. Come on Salesforce listen to your customers and get this done
Allow Live Agent to also transfer file to customer,Sherry Wan,Product Team Review,3000,15,This is a requirement for adopting Live Agent.,My business need this facility and even I think it's mandatory for the chat to be Live.,We've been asking for this for years. Live Agent is good but this type of direct interaction with customers would make it great!,Yes, we definitely need to have this capability.  It doesn't make sense to have it only for incoming chats.,we need it.,we love to have it,Absolute must have for CS teams! There is no logic in only receiving files from customers. It is essential for my company as well. ,A definite must have!,We are in a security industry and it is atmost important for us to not only have customer send us files but also agents send files back to customer. Must needed!,need this feature.. nice one,Much needed!!,nice idea!,This would be extremely helpful,This would be very helpful!,We need to be able to exchange files, etc. with a customer.  It should be a two-way exchange.  Definitely a must have.
Async Apex Usage Notification,Guy Clairbois,Under Point Threshold,50,2,Perfect Idea,O yes, good idea!
Do not change modified date of attachments when transferring case,Isis Lopez,Partial Delivery in Summer '15,1220,16,None,None,None,None,Any update on this known issue?,If an attachment is not actually being modified, only the account owner, it is illogical that the attachment dates are being changed.  PLEASE GIVE US THE OPTION TO SEE THE CREATED DATE INSTEAD OF THE LAST MODIFIED DATE!,I just wasted a bunch of time b/c of this bug.  Please add Created Date until it can properly be resolved!!!,None,None,"Where is Salesforce at regarding correcting this issue?  They have not responded to this thread for a year now.  Some users have suggested that Salesforce display the ""Created Date"" in the related list which I think is a perfect work around for this issue.  Why has that seemingly simple fix not been deployed?  Display the ""Created Date"" which will help all of us and work on the complications around the ""Last Modified Date"" afterwards.",None,This issue is impacting our business. Looking forward for the fix.,So meanwhile is it NOT a quick fix for Salesforce to add Created date to the related list?,None,None,Agree, this is a big design flaw, and consider a bug. Hope to see a resolution soon. It does create confusion to all support engineers when there are multiple attachments to a case.Trace of when each attachment was added in the case should be visible to the engineers. 
Enable rollup summary field to add up formula fields,Max Alexander,Under Consideration,19500,16,None,2 months and no comment from Salesforce???,I agree this would be quite helpful...the goal being that the RSF can aggregate fields from child objects that are themselves formula fields.  Thank you for your consideration!,None,None,None,Our use case is calculating multi-year pricing on quotes.  We apply a percent increase (from the header) to each applicable product line for years 2-5.  We then need to calculate the sum of those future prices.,My use case is this:  I need to display a total weight on an opportunity record.  The total weight should be a summary of the calculated weights of the individual opportunity products.  However, the opportunity product weight should be a calculation of the product case weight * quantity on the opportunity product.  Currently I have to populate the opportunit product weight with a process builder because the RSF cannot use the formula crossing the opportunity product and the product record.,There are many fields on the product that don't carry over to the opportunity product. I need them on the opportunity product so I can summarize them. For example a roll up summary based on the product family. To do so I need to create a workflow that updates the opp product family group with the product family group. This is not ideal, as it makes more work for me and clutters up workflows. Would prefer to use a formula but then can't use Rollup Summary. ,Ability to use formula fields including cross object formula fields would be very beneficial. It would eliminate many workflow rules written to work-around this issue.,This would be great to avoid creating more workflow rules just to update a simple number field to be used in a roll-up summary.,The ability to roll up cross object formula fields would be a HUGE benefit to us!  It's a constant roadblock in simplifying workflow.  ,None,None,None,Need to be able to summarize formula fields at grouping levels.
History Tracking for Users,Kristin Flewelling,Under Consideration,10850,16,None,We need this feature, especially for monitoring the service users.,No big deal. It's only been nine years of waiting for this. So far. ,with changes in legislation the need to attribute actions to users becomes more important.  when might this be completed?,I still see a strong need for this. ,Hi I really think it would be useful to have history tracking on the user. Last modified if fine, but need to see on who changed what in the user.  ,This will be really useful... As a Platform Manager and having our staff create users... It will be a good monitoring tool ,very important for compliance audits - currently need to build a dummy object to store fields that could easily sit on User for tracking changes. ,@kristie Garafola - Any update?  This is a huge deal when you need accountability in your data integrity.  As the Administrator to see users and which reports they are running, which accounts they edit, etc., is pretty important.,I would the ability to see history on the User object. This seems like it would benifit all orgs...,It would ve very useful to be able to track the historical change of head count in SFDC. For example, how many reps were in my sales team in June last year vs. June this year.,None,None,It would much easier to simply view the history of changes made to a user versus sifting through the audit trail, exporting, sorting, etc.,None,We also see great value in having the ability to run audits on what a user has changed," in particilar on the ""User"" object. We know we can now run history reports on many standard or custom objects", the user object is still falling short and is a critical item when you have someone who has changed user setting. 
Virtual Change set Validation/Deployment,Rajni Kant Roy,Under Point Threshold,110,9,please salesforce take this idea into consideration and try to implement ASAP.,Great idea.,The idea which can change the view of developer perfection.,Its great and unique idea.,Good Idea. It will reduce the errors that we come across prior to deployment while validating the change set against production enviornment. Also, it will reduce time of change set validation as well. ,Great,Great idea.,Good Idea. It will reduce the errors that we come across prior to deployment while validating the change set against production enviornment. Also, it will reduce time of change set validation as well. ,This is great idea. I was searching similar to that from last 2 months. please salesforce take this idea into consideration and try to implement ASAP.
Account Queue,Renee Callery,Under Consideration,5570,16,An update from the product team: We are exploring different options for group ownership of records, which may or may not explicitly involve queues. It's too soon to provide specific timing, but we'll update you as more information becomes available.,We really need this feature!,None,Badly needed this one.,Please Add,+1,None,Why overlook such an important object.,Needed functionality! Any update on when this will be solved? Using a licence to solve this has limitations,Great idea. This will be very useful.,Really usefull !!,None,This would be a really useful addition and would fit great with our business process.  Any update on the progress of Account Queues?,I agree.. Queues really need to be available for all objects, but especially accounts.  SF Licences are too expensive to use one as just a pool.  Since my company is moving away from using the Leads Object, we need to have a Queue for Accounts, for those that are dead in the water, or that nobody wants to have ownership on, especially since each account executive have strick guidelines on how many accounts they can have in Salesforce to keep the Data clean.  We don't want to delete any accounts due to the activity history, so a queue would be best to work with. ,We have a high business need to have queue on account. Our Sales Ops team reviews accounts prior to assigning account ownership and currently without assigning to a queue, we are unable to build a scalable solution. ,Salesforce, we desperately need to Account level queue!! Any commitment pls..
"Be able to filter by ""New Value"" and ""Old Value"" field on History Report Types",Iván Velasco,Product Team Review,15430,15,I have users that need this - but cannot provide as of yet...,Definately useful for my company, not only for drilling but also for applying formulas.,Need this feature!,That would be very useful!,Very useful and to see how many customers you have lost or won for instance,This would be useful to have.,We would find this very useful as well!,"This was in ""Product Team Review"" 5 months ago when I first posted.  ""Idea is being reviewed by Salesforce. We'll post an update in 2-4 months."".  Still no update from Salesforce.  Can we please get an update?  Thanks!",trying to setup a report right now that requires this. please add this functionality asap!,Agree, thius is very frustrating trying to do meaningful reporting with this report type not havingNew and Old value available as filters,This would be extremely helpful for my reporting needs.,Urgently needed! ,I can't believe you can't do this! Baffling.,I tried to write a report using the Lead History table today and thought the UI had broken but it turns out you just can't filter on New and Old value. Baffling! Please add this functionality.,This would be incredibly helpful for mass account transfers 
Retain original email when replying with a template,Michael Whitehurst,Product Team Review,3510,15,None,We really need this!,We need this,We need this feature!,We need this feature! ,This would be really helpful to maintain clean email history,Using Salesforce's built in email is clunky to say the least. This is something they should at least have an option for.,This is something basic and necessary for end users. Salesforce should consider to fix this as early as possible.,The basic of email management is missing. It is surprising that there is no way to retain the thread if using a template. Can we please have the ETA for this feature to be rolled out? I see so many people asking for it already.,Any update on this idea?,None,Need this for email-to-case please,None,None,None
Provide Word-Wrap for Long and/or Rich Text Fields,Michele Rowe,Product Team Review,4630,15,None,None,None,@Anthony Sellers, you may be right but after 7 years and a ton of votes it would be nice if SF at least acknowledged our issue, even if it was to say this isn’t possible due to reason x, y or z.,None,Please fix this issue. We need this.,With all the innovation comint from SFDC, perhaps something this rudimentary just seem boring.  Be that as it may, we still need to correction. ,None,This should be a setting on each List View ... Enable Wrap Text,We have many of these in our cases per day, and shortening the url is not possible. Please fix!,Gotta fix this.,+1,+1,None,We have to display urls and the distortion is very annoying to the users.
Omni Channel Routing based off case status,Logan Pounders,Under Point Threshold,940,15,None,We  need this,Absolutely required. Thank you for considering for the next release.,Come on Salesforce,Yes absolutely require this for our large user group.,need this!!,Need this,Can't believe this is not already here!,Yes we need this!,we need this! ,We need this, it would make live (and SalesForce) a little bit better..,Definitely need this!,We need this, it would make live (and SalesForce) a little bit better :-) ,None,This is exactly something we've been struggling with at our company.
"Opportunity : allow custom field in popup ""Select closed stage"" in Lightning",Pierre SUCHET,Under Point Threshold,1100,16,In order to build this feature we need the Dep picklist inline editing modal in Lightning. So Please vote for this idea and we can use the same feature for path: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000E47LQAS,This should really not be an idea. Its a missing functionality or a bug on the Sales path. When you try to close an Opportunity, and it has dependent, mandatory picklists, it is impossible to use the Sales Path to close the Opportunity, and blocks the user from moving forward. The close should ideally behave the same way as it does when you do Inline editing on the Sales Stage. ,+1,Please take care of the option to use this feature for pathes on customized objects, too.,In order to build this feature we need the Dep picklist inline editing modal in Lightning. So Please vote for this idea and we can use the same feature for path: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000E47LQAS,@Aria Niazi - A pop up modal of the fields would be very useful.,None,None,None,We are facing this exact issue in an implementation involving over 150k users. Need this.  ,None,"It's pretty rare not to have validation conditions when an Opportunity is closed.   This makes the feature Lightning ""Close"" feature pretty useless.   I'll be telling all my clients: you can 't use it""..",This is a bummer. Now I'm going to have to build in this feature that should be standard. :(,None,None,None
Ability to Add Invitees to events on Salesforce1,Deb Comm,Under Point Threshold,1760,15,None,This is making call tracking very hard for our team that often make joint calls together.,We REALLY need this for our team that just switched to Lightning!,Please make this possible! My users need the capability! Thanks!,Needed!,From our point if view," this is absolutely a must. I agree with the other comments made around this... We cannot get ""attacked"" by our people telling that they cannot arrange proper meetings on the go / on the road.",Need it,I am shocked that this functionality is not available on SF1.  This is the top activity of our Regional Vice Presidents.,this would save my team collectively 2 hours weekly.  Big deal!,This would help!,We want to keep sales on the road selling, and not have to do these types of tasks after hours; any efficiences help us move towards work-life balance.,This would add great productivity to our Account Executives!,To reduce corrupt sales time and improve work/life balance, this feature is important to the success field sales team.  ,having full feature selection on salesforce1 is the key to the success of the app. until this is available our sales professionals are made to use the desktop version which results in loss of entries and additional admin time,We desperately need this functionality to enable our Sales teams and grow adoption on SF1. It's mission critical that Sales people can add their managers and peers to their calls. Our Sales SVP's report on this information monthly.
printable view in reports on the lightning experience?,Amy Perkins,Product Team Review,4130,15,Very essential. ,This is CRITICAL for our company, as well!,Please allow chart to print as well as the report detail.  ,This would be something very helpful for our team. Looking forward to this being available for both printing and exporting data to share with others who do not have licenses!,Provide solution soon,I have 2 Corporate Management people that require reports and Dashboard Reports that are not users in Salesforce. I would like to export the report and charts and email to these people. ,We need this as well... ,Yes, definately need to to migrate to lightning. ,200% needed.,Gah so frustrating searching Google for help with Lightning only to find page after page on Ideas here meaning it's not available.  Like why make a new interface and then cripple it without having the same functionality from the original version?  Lightning makes charts look SO much better, yet we can't print them!!!!,None,Must have for external communications. Tabular is fine to export but we need summary reports to be distributed.,None,Extremely crucial for our business. This is one of the reasons why we haven't implemented Lightning yet. Please deliver this functionality ASAP.,Printable format is crucial for our businesses to maintain the proper sorting format from Salesforce to Excel.
Lookup field in Visual Workflow,Prod Support,Under Point Threshold,1270,13,This will really add a lot of value to the flow functionality.,I heard on one of the release webinars that Salesforce was working on revamping the Visual Flow to make it more intuitive and user friendly.  This needs to be on the product development list.,Lookup field in Visual Workflow - This is really needed. ,yes, please. We have flow for creating a new opportunity, when they create from the tab instead of the account/contract, we need to ask them which account. We do not want to force them to create from account/contract. We let them create on any account whether they own it or not, so filtering with a dynamc choice within flow won't work. It's lots of extra clicks to have them enter account name,/partial name on one screen and then choose the one they want on the next screen. So, instead we have to do vf / lc so that we can ask them for the account in the easiest way for them to answer with an auto-complete to boot.,Great Idea!!! Willbe very helpful and save us lot of time building the workaround.,I hope Salesforce re-prioritizes and starts to develop a solution - this creates a lot of work arounds for the lookup behavior. ,Yes, flow becomes useless in many use cases without such a feature. It's a pity to need to develop because of that gap....,Really Needed.,This one little gotchya forced us to go custom dev, with a Lightning component. Everything else was achievale vai flow, minus this lookup field.,This is really needed,I was surprised to discover this functionality isn't available. I'm building a visual flow to take input related to multiple Contacts, and wanted to be able provide a lookup to the contact's name fro each record entered.,Having the abiliity to add a Lookup field to a Flow would be great. The Dynamic Choice field works differently depending on what API version of your developer org or sandbox org you are working in. I have the same configuration that displays the dynamic choices as a dropdown in my developer org but when I try to run the same exact Flow in my client's sandbox, it does not display any of the choices in the dropdown. The Dynamic Record Lookup is configured exactly the same.,This would be fantastic. Can't believe this hasn't been implemented already.... and has so little votes at that.
"Add option to default ""Send Notification Email"" to checked when changing owner",Administrator,Product Team Review,9990,15,"Would be very helpful to have the ""Send notification email"" default to checked when changing the Case Owner to a Queue. ",None,It can be helpfull but only if it will be per profile based, because it will not make sense to have it turned off or turned on for whole org. ,None,None,Found way to check this box in this feed. https://success.salesforce.com/answers?id=90630000000CkVSAA0 ,That is the same answer that Salesforce gives.  Unfortunately it means that control of sending that email is no longer optional; and while I agree that in most cases we DO want to send that email (which is why the request to let us have that option checked by default makes sense); there are a few times where a number of records are being handled simultaneously and it just creates workflow disruptions to send effectively the same email over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and......... over and over again.,A workaround is to create a Process via Process Builder and check if Lead Owner has been changed. If true you can send an email Alert to the new owner,None,This feature would help everyone.,This would be very helpful.,This change would benefit our entire team!,This would be very helpful,This would be very helpful for us!,This would be very beneficial for us!
Ability to share list view with group in lightning,Nick Lindberg,Under Point Threshold,340,2,I was able to adjust these list view settings by switching back to Classic mode and editing the Sharing Settings there (to share with Groups). The changes reflect in Lightning after switching back. Although I agree it really should be something which can be adjusted from Lightning mode.,This functionality is sorely needed. Voted!
Notifications and Alerts for Social Listening,Sarah Daily,Under Point Threshold,110,1,Agreed -- I am working with a team that would like notifications like you get in Facebook that would alert for every reply to your posts that were published, this actually creates quite a challenge for their current workflow.
Display Flow / Process Builder validation errors on screen for user,Steven DeMeola,Under Point Threshold,2080,8,This is greatly needed, especially since the more explicit message only goes to the last person to modify the built process. That person may not even be related in any way to the company anymore!,Having the process builder wait steps with record id show up in the Time-Based Workflow area of set up, that would be helpful. OR having the record id Paused and Waiting Interviews here would be helpful as well as on the detail record page for the flow interview wait step.,YES - thank you for posting this. I just completed a case that was open for a month and a half with support that boiled down to a validation rule being hit. In our PB+F, we are iterating through loop to update a family of records. Since once record was violating a validation rule, it was erroring. When you're looking at a loop of 150 - 200 records, you have no idea where to start - even as an Admin - with just a generic 'Error Occurred During Flow.',Merge with idea: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000DhhhAAC,None,I agreee Salesforce, please start focusing and delivering on automation. I feel like the core stuff end users, implemenation experts want implemented is not being delivered soon enough,"""Failed to trigger a flow"" errors are not of much use. The reason for the failure should be displayed to the user", because as Steven mentions the users can then solve the problem on their own sometimes.,This is very beneficial. It not only avoids the unnecessary troubleshoots by the user before reaching out to the Admin, but also creates a learning experience. Great idea!
Create true Pardot Sandbox environments,Mike McNeeley,Under Point Threshold,450,3,I would also love to have a sandbox environment with the ability to clone from production so that we can keep in line with our salesforce expectations.,For Pardot to really take the next step they need to support true test environments with deployable elements across environments to support application lifecycle best practices. At a minimum if we could at least have the current Pardot test orgs you request not have an expiration date if requested otherwise that would be a simple step in the right direction. As an SI partner with a need for reliable demo environments for our clients this is a real need. ,None
Lightning Dashboard Custom colors for Charts,Pritam Shekhawat,Under Point Threshold,930,15,Adding custom colors woud provide more flexibility.,Please add the ability for colors,Agreed. We need to be able to use the use the Assign Custom Colours for picklists in Lightning dashboards or the Picklist 'Assign Custom Colours' because pretty useless. ,Really need this functionality so our users will embrace lightning reports and dashboards.,Its will be great functionality to have which helps to categorize the records with different colors.,Really need this capability as we embrace Salesforce at the executive level of our corporation!,Custom colors would be great for reporting! For example, Red/Yellow/Green indicators are a common status metric across organizations and business units, would be great to color code reports to match.,Custom coloring is a must as it provides a very visual example of the flexibility of the platform,We are in the 21st century.  Custom colors a must.,Businesses use diferent colors to represent difiernt things - they should not have to go backwards becuse they upgraded ,Would be nice to have a call-to-action colour available ,Custom colors are a must to provide Salesforce users with the fliexibility to really tailor their reports and highlight problems within the organization. ,Would be nice to have a call-to-action colour available that will stand out,It's a no-brainer.  Custom colors would make it quicker and easier for people to take information on board.,It would be great to have custom colors in aiding visual cues for an audience. 
Allow email-to-case to store attached files in Attachment Area of case,Accipiter,Product Team Review,3250,15,This is a much needed feature.,Much Needed please allow us an early Hiliday present!!,We are also looking to have attachement uploaded as case attachment from the email along with attachments under emails related list.Please consider this feature,This is a huge requirement for our client. We've set up Service Cloud for an insurance company who recieves heavy Email-to-Case traffic. These Emails often include attached images. Instead of quickly being able to these attachments on the Files-related list on the case layout they have to also open the related email-record, then open the attachment, and then click View file. They then have to go back to the email and look at the next attachment. This is incredibly time consuming.,Can't believe this is not a feature.,None,This is the native behavior when adding attachments from SFO as well. Files are stored on the Activity not in Files.,None,This would be a huge timesaver. ,Cleare in my opinion,Will help a lot to increase the visiibility of attached documents.,I agree,None,AGREE,None
Customize lead convert,Kapow Marketing,In Development,31640,16,None,"Yess! Need to have the option to default create opportunity to ""no"" - we always forget and have a ton of $0 opps out there!",And please consider to make the conversion page editable, too.,I need also different convert page layouts for different users / groups / roles,None,record type mapping in absolutely required. When is it going to be rolled out? Could you please update us with the future roadmap on this? ,1 is the absolute top priority, and 2 is a big deal, too.  As part of item 2, when converting a lead to merge it with an existing contact, this should go to the same data comparison screen that is part of the merge process for both leads and contacts.  It's very inconsistent (and inconvenient) that in this particular merge scenario you aren't given options for which data to keep and which to discard. This is also mentioned here: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000Bq2EAAS,Any chance this will be rolling out on the next release? 1 and 4 are a priority!!,None,We really need #3 and the ability to search directly from the conversion page like you are able to do with accounts. Is this coming in Summer or is it possible to roll out sooner?  This is a very high priority for us. ,Customizing the convert page layout and different convert page layouts for different users would be useful also.,Is this coming in Summer 17?,None,Number 1 and 4,#4 definitely most required.  ,#4 is the most useful feature.
Choose Who To Send Flow Fault emails and Process Builder Error Emails to,David Reece,Product Team Review,5460,15,David Bremmer - great point on people not knowing it's needed.  I had a conversation with a developer a few weeks ago who was complaining about error messaging in PB/Flows being not helpful and vague.  Turns out he's never seen these error emails because the admin that created all of the flows was no longer active. ,PS -- @Salesforce: I truly believer that the only reason that this hasn't topped the minimum point threshold is that most people don't realize how much they need it! ,None,"A better solution would be to have a ""system user"" that you can activate these under and set as the email address to without having to burn up a license. This way if an admin leaves you don't have to reactivate every flow in the org.",None,I cannot believe that we can't designate an org-wide email to send these to. We do multiple deployments sometimes in a week and our flows are constantly changing names. It's a bit ridiculous that our troubleshooting process has to include finding out who last modified the flow so we can even see what went wrong.,Agree - we desperately need this.  We heavily use flows and the creator is no longer with our company!,Are there any known work arounds for this? I need these emails to goto our IT Service desk rather than a named user!,We've got more than one admin in our organization. Need to update all of them contemporary.,Really required - And a question: The only posts i've found about this mention that the creator gets the emails. Isn't it really the last modified by?? If not, must one really clone, save as a totally different Flow/Process Builder Process name, then deactivate the old one??,This is definitely needed!,Definitely required!,We are two admins in the organisation. We should be both able to receive the notifications to ensure timely actions.,Completely agree, this should be possible,Definitely useful!
Allow restore/undelete of Opportunity Product Line Items,James Goerke,Under Point Threshold,620,13,"The only warning I got before I accidentally deleted a signed and completed opportunity was ""Are you sure?"".  If you can't make this a feature"," at least make the warning stronger.  Something to the effect of ""If you delete this"," it will ONLY be available to be recovered from a backup file""",None,This is wreaking havoc in our data warehouse,This is badly needed.,None,Yes. It will be nice to have this feature,It should be perfect!!! Opportunities are very important and when we are not full setting for the level of accessible, it may risk your bussiness!,it should be backed up like other objects in salesforce.,This should be tracked.... for the conveniences of the users.,I am experiencing the same issue as Tarak.  This will be very helpful!!!,We are syncing Opportunities and Opportunity Products into another system. Without deleted flag, it is extremely hard to remove deleted items from the destination.,This will be very helpful!!,it should be backed up like other objects in salesforce.
Lightning Dashboard filtered source report for drill down,Johan Yu,Under Point Threshold,320,2,Very Nice idea Johan ! Looking forward to have this in Salesforce,None
Add Reply to ALL / Reply buttons to top of Email,Dave Silva,Under Point Threshold,520,9,Yes, this would be helpful.,None,Good idea,Like many firms we migrated from an Outlook heavy user workflow. Usability items like having the Reply/Reply All at the top of the email record in feed would create a consistent (and more efficient) experience as we move more and more workflows into Salesforce. ,In the meantime, I found that if you have the email open (not minimized/shrunk)," you can do CTRL-F to ""find"" and then search for Reply All and click Next.  This is still cumbersome though and I still promote this idea.",this is better than a great idea its an enterprise solution to an enterprise problem. please implement asap,None,I love this idea. It would be great not only to have the Reply/Reply All button at the top, but also the attachments of the mail.,Great idea... when the email string on a case gets long, it's cumbersome to have to scroll to the bottom of the email thread to Reply or Reply All.
Cross Object Merge Fields in Email Template,Matt Brown,Under Consideration,13860,16,None,This should be a standard functionality. + why does it take 8 years to get this change?? Is this even still on the roadmap?,This would be fantastic as we had 2 different teams requesting similiar functionality today in our org.,This would certainly simplify the logic needed for doing the merge and eliminate the need for extra fields.  Please consider doing it.,This should be standard functionality. It's a huge bottleneck to bring in developers to do this through Apex. ,Would love to see this functionality. It is much needed. ,@Kristie Garafola, Product Management either needs to fix this, or remove fields that are not available to be used on the template (ie. anything not present on the core object), if it's not going to be fixed. Pretty simple...?,Posted 8 years ago? Last response 2 years ago? Is something still be considered or not?  It would be so useful!,How long has this been under consideration?,Very much needed.,Last comment from SF Team was 2 years ago for a fewature that has a ton of backing, is a huge need, and should not be that hard to implement. With a support team as large as SF, things like this should not be open for 7 years..,None,This is MUST feature that will save so much metadata duplications. Helpful stuff,None,None,This is something that everyone seems to need... Please add this to the Spring '17!
More than 4 fields on Related List in Lightning Experience,Varun Pilla,In Development,5860,16,None,None,Thanks for the update Eric, good to know Salesforce are listening, please keep us in the loop should the target release date change.,None,+1 we have a client requirement for lightning where they want to display in list format 6-10 fields on maybe 20 different related lists. It would be super nice if I dont need to make a custom VFP to deal with this requirement. Project timeline 3 months. . . Tick Tock =) ,For a facelift that is years overdue, Lightning falls short on so many levels. This is one of those no-brainers that SF can't seem to figure out. And what's with the giant news feed box? Who in the world needs a news feed on their SF layout. News from a gazillion other sites is a click away in another tab in your browser. Maybe a stock ticker will be the next big update for lightning?,Will this include having the action column (or at least the checkboxes) show on the related list cards? This is a huge issue for us right now that doesn't seem to have a workaround other than asking clients to click onto a whole new page to do a simple action.,+1 for less white and more info on every page!,Most related lists need more than 4 columns to be really useful to the user.,Quick update on this idea: We are targeting the Summer '17 release to expose customization of the number of columns for related list cards (Safe Harbor). In the meantime, going to the full related list drill-in page via the 'View All' link will allow users to see all the columns for the related list.,None,Really critical to allow additional columns as in Classic. Very limiting right now and limits the usability considerably.,Atleast 10 fields same as classic.,Unfortunately another step back if you migrate to Lightning. The related lists are one of the powerful features we all loved in Classic and I don't understand why this is so limited even one year into Ligthning.,+1,None
Conditional formatting of field values,Oliver Cornes,Under Consideration,23810,16,None,We would also really like to use this without having to resort to adding even more formula fields showing images or resorting to Apex code. ,None,Any update on this?,We have a need for this type of formatting as well. In particular we have YTD summary roll up fields on a record which detail if a site is meeting their financial and/or delivered goals. Having items that are NOT meeting the goal highlighted would help draw attention. @Kristie Garafola can you please provide an update on the status? Thank you. ,another basic function missing in the analytics package. I'm excited to seen when such basics get fixed. One of the key adoption issues with executive managements is the limitted analytics package of SFDC and the need to step out of SFDC and into MS PP and Excel means we loose our executives in supporting SFDC as they get better results form other tools. SF need to think about if this will help their business long term if executives are not convinced about the capabilities.,Adding my vote.  I could really use this for my team to draw attention to parts of a complicated process that are behind schedule and need to be addressed.,needs to be in reports as well.,I saw the link to the highlighter tool just recently posted by Steve Roch, so much appreciated there, will assess getting our admin to get this going. I am just curious why such a basic, value add feature and need and that is native to almost any other system is not already baked in the product. As an account manager for several large west coast accounts, I run across customers all the time looking to get off Salesforce because they cant do some of the most basic functions as they can do in other systems and tools. Why does it have to be yet another app, yet another customization? I like SF as a company but come-on this is foundational, value add feature that would keep people more productive and staying on Salesforce versus at looking at options to get off.,Hi all. We contacted Salesforce Support on this request and it looks like they added this functionality in a later release. I would suggest you reach out to Salesforce to get some guidance on how to set it up. I'll also update this post after we have had a chance to test it out.,Would be really useful - would reflect basic Excel functionality,None,None,Are there any updates on this idea? It would be a huge benefit to our Support organization.,What a great idea.  Please consider.,None
Increase the limit on the number of reports a user can subscribe to,Emily Knox,Product Team Review,4570,15,None,Increasing the subscription limit would be very helpful. ,A must, need to be able to have multiple reports sent to multiple employess,Yes, please! ,This so necessary - need reminders and need to be able to keep on top of what is happening.,5 subscriptions is extremely limiting.  I don't need 100, but 10 would be far better.  Daily would also be quite helpful.,Considering I can't send to external email addresses and need to build a complex set of Outlook rules to route all reports......subscription limit of 5 is brutal.,Please, please, please increase the limit. End users love the subscription feature.,Increasing the subscription limit would be very helpful. ,Sounds like a great idea. Will also enable users to have their own specific reports,Sounds like a great idea,Hey Salesforce, can you weigh in here? You're silent on an issue that impacts many of us. ,None,Great feature - need more subscriptions!,None
Empty Sandbox Template Confirmation,Andrea Borsani,Under Point Threshold,100,0
Deactivate Salesforce Success Community Profiles,Marty Chang,Under Point Threshold,1520,11,Maybe Salesforce should use Pardot to send out an email to verify that these community profiles are attached to REAL user emails.  Let's get it cleaned up!,Yes, please!!,Yes, please!,None,Yes, please . . . I have way too many community profiles. I'd really prefer to have just one.,Yes PLEASE!!!,Totally agree: it should be easier to manage user accounts in the Success Community...,I'd like to be able to CHOOSE which login of mine is used when I log into a community.  I too have access to multiple Salesforce instances, and it seems to always log me in automatically based on the last one I logged into.  (I often have several open at once in different tabs).,None,I'd be more in favor of making it possible to merge multiple accounts.  That way you could log in as any of your existing personas, and yet choose one profile that represented multiple logins.,None
Save Email as Draft on Salesforce (Lightning Experience),Christopher Calub,Under Point Threshold,40,0
Scheduled emailing of reports includes CSV,Amber Boaz,Product Team Review,5250,16,Hi all, including CSV and Excel is 3-4 releases out. Thanks for your patience!,"Can't wait for this to be available.  I hope that there will be an ""include CSV"" button on the report", or as an option somewhere in the scheduling window.,Any update on this -has been 3-4 releases -right? ,Hey Claudio Castro, any chance of moving this up in the schedule? manually doing this is painful. While there are external options, looking for this to be supported by salesforce.,Yes we need this,Definitely would benefit from this feature.,Looking forward to this one getting released!,It will be great to have this function! Thnak you,None,This functionality would be great.,Looking forward for the Release.,We need this!,This should be most priority in Salesforce list. Hope they consider the need. ,this would be great help if include in next release..,Even when this is up and running, if you don't have a developer handy, you will be stuck with the limitation of how many can go out daily. For some this may not be an issue. Looked up Report Builder by Cloud4J (mentioned below in the chat string), and it looks promising. Not too expensive either. Anybody recommend it?,Is there a clearer picture of which release and when in 2017?
All show all records in lookup search,James Wellington,In Development,9550,16,All, thanks to your continued feedback, the product team has revisited this request and added it to the 3 release roadmap, currently set for delivery next year (safe harbor applies, of course). We will update this space with more concrete timing and details as we get closer. ,None,All, thanks to your continued feedback, the product team has revisited this request and added it to the 3 release roadmap, currently set for delivery next year (safe harbor applies, of course). We will update this space with more concrete timing and details as we get closer. ,While the new Lightning lookup functional is helpful, it does not address the request. Users should be able to see all related records available to them either within the lookup or when they search. Having recent records or records that match part of a search does not provide the user will a simple list of avabile related records. PLEASE reconsider this as an option. Thank you. ,None,None,None,Sami Caracand - thank you so much for that suggestion!  It works perfectly for this master data lookup where the data set will by nature always be small enough to return all records.,None,Hi Sami, I identified a similar workaround 2 years ago. It works if there are a small number of records, but as Jim Williams identified, it fails with larger record set sizes.,None,This is much required for users to save few clicks. ,These search limitations are extremely frustrating for our users.  We also are not ready to convert to Lightning yet; this fix is something we really need in Classic.,None,This needs to be fixed in CLASSIC. Why are things we've wanted for years being fixed, but only in Lightning.,This is probably the most frequently complained about functionality in Salesforce in all my time of implementing SF solutions and has caused many user adoption issues.  Most users initially do not know what they are searching for and so the lookup should allow a wildstar (all) search. Enforcing at least 2 characters is too restrictive.   
Add Date Formulas to Custom Summary Formulas on Reports,Matthew Rumschlag,Product Team Review,9400,15,It would be an very important feature where any business needs to track. I would be of great help if this is impletemented in salesforce.,This would be enormously helpful as Analysts and regular power users could drive some much needed data without having to rely on already overburdoned Admins to solve the issue...,A very convenient feature!,Trying to calculate the differences of effective activity date and closed date in activity report, but not able to do so without Date formula in summary report formula builder. Would be really helpful if Salesforce can implement this idea or someone can develop a method for this!,It would be great to show how far into a datespan we are (start date .... today ... expected end date ... ) but no way to do that without adding a formula to the object(s) being reported on.  Please add dates to report formulas.,Pretty much needed functionality! ,I need it too ,@Carter Smith, thank you for your detailed explanation of the differences between the solution in the post and the solution proposed in this idea. That is very helpful. To be clear - I am still voting for this idea and I see the value in it. I had come accross the post on criteria and thought maybe it could speak to some users experiencing issues reporting dates - but I recognize that the criteria does not substitute for what being able to fully summarize could do for users. We need more, Salesforce!,@Evelyn Tomer, While that post is interesting, and I use that feature a lot, it actually doesn't speak to this issue at all. It doesn't help me calculate the amount of time between the creation date of two records and sort in the summary by how long that difference is. It doesn't let me pull in the first or most recent record within a summary report. These are the kinds of things we expect to be able to do within reporting, instead of wasting time pulling them out into excel (which does this natively in the pivot tables) or by creating lots of formula fields on objects that are only needed for a few reports.,None,What is the roadmap for this functionality? This is must neeed but still not available and in order to achieve the same lot of date formula fields are required to be created on objects leading to field wastage on objects. Appreciate if this can be released in Summer'17.,This is a must needed functionality. I could really use this to calculate the time between last logins. ,None,Bueler..... Bueler.... Bueler.....,How has this been a problem for so long?  This seems like a very basic feature that add a LOT of value.

Feature Forecast! Pick one: User filtering or search on related lists,Eric Shih,Product Team Review,2780,15,Filtering, please!,Filtering. This would reduce the need to Show More/Go to List in half for our organization, thus creating a more concise snapshot of important data.,filtering,User filtering would be a great feature!,filtering,Filtering - inLine please,User Filtering please,None,Filtering! As a user I want to be able to filter my related lists and save those filters so i can get an at-a-glance view of a particular type of related record and hide the irrellevant records without asking my admin to create a separate view for me. I want to flip between all records and just one type of records on demand. I would rather see a filtered list of related records that I can save and come back to than have to use a search feature every time i need to reference the list.,Filtering...in Lightning...on RLs and have type ahead logic,User filtering with the abilty to keep that view in place as the default would be very helpful.,User filtering would be preferred, IMHO.,User filtering,User Filtering,Filtering
Show related lists 'Partners' & 'Competitors' under opportunities (LEX),Maarten van Heeren,Under Point Threshold,900,15,We need it on accounts ASAP!,Yes, needed by my client as well!,Very important for us to have this.,Absolutely vital for our process. ,Opportunities often have several partners of interest and I'm surprised and disappointed this is not an included functionality. It's vital to our process. Without it, switching to LEX is unlikely for the team I lead.,Can't believe this is not included,This is essential for our business to be effective and work well on LEX,Disappointed that it was not there to begin with and still not there....,This feature needs to be available in Lightning immediately. I am not sure why it wasn't ready to work right away; the 'Partner' related list is a crucial part of accounts and opportunities.,Without this feature we're unable to switch to LEX as it limits our sales process functionality. ,Unfortunately, this feature is missing again. Without it we cannot switch to LEX!!,I was very disappointed that this functionality is not yet included in the Spring 2017 release. We need this!,Needs to be included ASAP,This is a crucial important update that needs to be implemented in SF lightening. Partners are a big part of our business and we are forced to use the classic verison instead of lightening because of this. ,Agree that look up solution is not ideal. What is missing is the reciprocal roles. 
Enable Default Picklist Values on Dependent Picklists,Matt Kaufman,Under Consideration,4180,16,All, the team is currently evaluating this idea for our our future roadmp. Nothing concrete is planned, so we will keep this space updated as we know more. ,We need this!,This would be a great improvement,Yes, please. ,We really need this badly!,Yes, please! ,Yes, please! I just explained this limitation to a user today and he was understandably perplexed.,None,Dependent picklist value should also be defaulted in addition to select for other value if default is not appropriate, means rather than showing '--None--' value it should show the default value for controlling field.,The beauty of dependent picklists is data integrity.  By not allowing a default entry to be set, you are losing some of the data integrity value.,None,None,This should definitely work.  It has been on the request list for multiple years.  I am shocked that it still does not work.,This will be helpful.,This will be really helpful. Thanks!,"If this is the correct ""functionality""", then you shouldn't be able to select a default value on a dependent picklist!
Convert Lead process in New Lightning UI (Automatic create Account),Pritam Shekhawat,Partial Delivery in Spring 17,5510,16,None,Is anything coming for this in Summer '17?  ,None,None,None,Hi @Reshma Jewrani.  I've tested the functionaltiy in production today and it works.  I'd suggest that you verify the custom field mapping by going into the lead object: Setup > Object Manager > Lead.  In the upper right corner of the Fields & Relationships section, you'll click on the Map Lead Fields button.  Check to see that your lead custom fields are being mapped as you'd like to the Account, Contact and/or Opportunity objects.,None,None,None,@Felix Leber Thanks. Another follow up question. In my scenario I have multipe Account Record Types and there is a field on Lead  object which determines which Record Type the Account should be converted into. Is there a way to leverage that field and convert Account based on that pick list value in the field?,None,None,To clarify: they attempt to create the Account and the Lead Company is autopopulated (great).   However when they attempt to save they get a Duplicate Rule error because the Account name matches the Lead Company.   The only workaround is to create the Account first, then associate at the time of conversion.,This has broken my client's Sales process considerably.   Almost all of their Lead conversion result in new Accounts and now they have to: attempt to create a new Account and get rejected by duplicate rules (matching Lead Company); then retry which ultimately works.,None,None
Ability to filter out or pull a specific record from a related list.,Deb Hurraw,Under Point Threshold,500,5,Must have,I would like to filter a lead queue to show only the oldest lead in the queue to stop people from cherry-picking leads.,I would definitely use this for so many reasons on various objects.,None,Yes yes - this would be so helpful!

The Ideas object is not available in Salesforce Lightning,Jessie Wilson,Under Point Threshold,1390,6,I am baffled why it isn't available in LEX.,We use Ideas, but want to move to Lightning. Please make this available in Lightning.,None,Totally agree, such an easy to use platform, why not make it available in Lightning.  Would like to know if there are plans for this or another feedback solution?,I agree that this should be available in Lightning.  This is a tool that we're looking to utilize to be a significant time save by helping us manage the vast number of ideas/suggestions that come in.  We don't have any other tools internally that allow the user community to self police the suggestions so that we can focus our energy on the items that matter most to the users and the organization instead of reviewing the large numbers of suggestions we've seen already.,None

It has already been 3 years ...,None,None,This is a critical requirement for our business - please support this in the next release. Thanks!,Important feature to be working across both customizable and collaborative forecasting. ,None,We need this feature on Collaborative Forecasts so we can support multiple businesses.,Must need this,Please, improve the forecasting so that you can determine which date an opportunity can be counted against. I know we can do that in customizable forecasting but that is so limited in other ways.
SANDBOX -  REFRESH ABILITY BETWEEN SANDBOXES,Jeremy Metzler,In Pilot/Beta,9420,16,None,I would like the ability to clone sandbox to sandbox (that belongs to two different production orgs). We have new business partners adopting to Salesforce orgs and we don't have a mechanism to clone the meta-data quickly from one org to another org.,None,This would be very beneficial for us and save so much time, thank you,Sorry this is a silly question but will this feature only clone meta-data only or will it include meta-data and data?,None,This could be super helpful. ,Looking forward this....,This is great idea for companies with tens of developers who are working on more projects and they would like to create clone of their sandbox for testers to test their current status but they would like to still work on other ongoing parts of code. Thumps up!! ,Thanks for the update, @Claudio.  Even if it is not the news I would hope to hear, I love the transparency and communication.,None,very useful feature for backup creation and restoration ..Eargerly waiting ,Would be a big time saver in Production support scenarios.,This is going to absolutely save tons of times for testing environment build. This feature should be in place from day one.,None,None
Ability to change/create data type Report Folder Names & Move Reports,Brian Kwong (DO NOT USE),Product Team Review,9040,16,Update: This is very high on our backlog and it is something we definitely need to fix. We won't be able to address it in the next 2 releases. As of right now, we are 3-4 releases out for it. Thanks!,@claudio castro do you have any updates about the report types folder/data category? @roxanne shakeri,"Another really simple really good idea. Seems like a no brainer just like ""Files"".",Without this adding report types and making them useful to report creators is very limiting.,None,What, this is not in Spring '17?  How can a ticket with this many points be delayed for 3-4 more releases?  Yet another example of really basic improvements being bypassed in favor of building out Lightning, Einstein, etc. etc.  Can we not have both?,Can we get an update from product management on this request? If the last comment from Salesforce PM still holds, shouldn’t this be coming into the next release?,Needed asap. ,Yes, please - report / dashboard organization in general could use a major overhaul, and this would be a great first step.,Organization of reports, basic functionality.,This is also a need for our organization. We depend heavily on custom objects and need to organize reporting. We are creating too many duplicates, losing productivity searching for a report, and making the Salesforce admins very cranky. Appreciate the update Claudio, but we have waited w-a-a-a-y too long for something that should have been released at the same time creating new report types were enabled. Please get this prioritized.,Glad to see this is scheduled for release! This is super crucial!,"The sooner this is delivered the better. We have a large number of custom objects and the number of report types in ""other"" makes things unmanagable.",3-4 realeases means 9-12 months? or less?,Please do not put this off. This enhancement would have a huge positive impact on reports and dashboard adoption by our ussers. We are a global organization and the ability to make it easier for end users to find the reports that they need is critical. ,Update: This is very high on our backlog and it is something we definitely need to fix. We won't be able to address it in the next 2 releases. As of right now, we are 3-4 releases out for it. Thanks!
Printable view in Lightning Experience,Swayam Chouksey,Under Point Threshold,720,13,Need to be able to print/export to PDF an opportunity like we did from Salesforce Classic. Important documentation we can share with external constituents and non-salesforce users.,I've upvoted for this, otherwise some of the reports I've created don't look the way they were intended to.  Thank you,None,Customers are asking for this.,None,None,None,Agree, need this as well as for Lightning Calenders.,printers are so 2016,None,Am surprised this is not available. I sometimes need to print a hard copy for a file but cant in lightning and i dont want to go back to classic just to print a record off. ,Yes, please!  Add the print icon & view back to pages.  ,None
Assignment Rules for Custom Objects,KSadler,Under Point Threshold,2300,15,We set up assignment rules under workflow rules on custom object and also set field update !,Agreed.  Just ran into a use case where this would have come in handy.,this would greatly help us,None,We would love this feature,It is required.. still not provide?,Much Needed functionality. As a workaround, we can use workflow rules with field updates.,Looking forward this feature.,Looking forward this feature.,Looking forward this feature too,Looking forward this feature too,This feature would be very useful and might be an easy win for salesforce.,I was just looking at a new case today where this would have really helped us solve a current issue we have.,I'd love to see this as well.,Really needed for the platform, especially for Consoles
Enable Action Links (Edit & Del) to be hidden on ListViews and Related Lists,Jackie Travieso,Under Consideration,8630,16,All, this functionality is on our list to support, though not on the immediate roadmap. We will update this space as the product team identifies more concrete timing. ,I would be very happy with this feature.,None,I cant't remove the action column on related list, It makes me unhappy!,We need this as well, any update on timeline to implement?  My users are deleting records by mistake causing integration errors with other systems.,Please provide update as to when this idea will be implemented,is there any update on this?,Due to restrictions on which of the related records can be edited, we want to drive all edits through a custom button on the parent object and remove the Edit and Delete links from the related list. However, we want to continue using the standard UI to edit the record, and the users need permissions to modify the records we allow edits to. There is currently no way to do this while continuing to use the standard UI.,We definitely need to have the option to remove Delete Campaign Member Access from the profile. As Campaign Members are added to Campaigns via automation, users shouldn't be able to remove those members but the ability to update their Campaign Member Status.  This is a standard object and should have the same simple access features, Edit, Delete, etc on the Campaign Member object.  Thank you Salesforce if you can deliver this!,I would like to take away the 'Edit' link but leave the 'Del' link in the 'Actions' column for certain objects and remove the 'Actions' column entirely for some other objects,None,None,Yes, we really need this functionality! We have Users that we don't want to have the capability to Delete. This should be Permission based within the Profiles.,we so need this capability ASAP!!!!,We really need this and have needed it for like 8 years at every company I have consulted at or worked at full time.,Agree!
Add History tables to Custom Report Types,Moira Heath,Product Team Review,5500,15,Great idea, upvote!,It would be very useful,We sure could use this!,This is definitely a necessary enhancement. Don't make me export two reports and merge-pivot them every single time!,This is incredibly necessary.  After all the enhancements being released, I can't believe this isn't one of them.,Need this feature soon.,Little disappointed when I recognized that this is not possible and just an idea... so I will create formula fields again.,This would be so useful in reporting,We do need it..please implement.,This is very much needed.,Needed !,None,This is starting to be asked more and more from our end users. This would solve many issues.,Yep, just had an end-user requesting to be able to search the history on a custom object.  I dread finding a Salesforce Idea that is 7 years old, with lots of Points, never solved, and silence from Salesforce.,Really necessary good idea
Customize Error Messages for Invalided Approval Process,Yoshifumi Hori,Product Team Review,8840,15,I am surprised that this is still not part of the basic functionality of approval processes. It is absolutely important to make the error message appear in the context of the user and business. The current error message (as of API v39) is technical in nature for admin/dev but not for end user. We need to manage this today with end user training which is not ideal.,9 years ago...,This is a time suck for support teams who get continual emails asking why their submission didn't go through and they think it's a technical/security issue.  ,C'mon sf! How many years and points does it take to get even a reply?  We are all wasting precious development time solving approval process error requests because this issue apparrently has not even been looked at, let alone fixed.  Please take a break from adding new broken functionality and finish what you guys have already started.,Thumps up! Most of sales receiving invalid approval process error message thinks that they do not have access, salesforce is not working properly or system has some maintenance. It would be more clearly inform them that approval process does not meet criteria or etc. ,We can do this with validation rules, why not approvals? Biggest source of phone calls!,At a bare minium we should be able to create a custom error message, with enough room to add a checklist of items for our users to review. But really, the error message should be able to just display the missing criteria.,This would be a superb feature and save me a great deal of time sniffing out why records cannot be submitted.,8 years! Wow, this has been an issue for our company for 8 years! UX FAIL.,Any updates on this 8 year old request for basic functionality?,Any update to this? Or has any one developed a work around.,How is this still not implemented??? It's been a huge pain point for our org since day 1. It seems like such a simple thing to be able to customize that error message, to at least let the user know what constitutes an acceptable submission. It boggles the mind how this could sit here for 8 years and not get addressed.,Yes this is a problem for us too.  The user should not have to ask the administrator why his record cannot be submitted for approval.  ,I don't understand why this has been here for 8 years, and still has yet to be implimented. This is a frustration for my org, and seems like it should be pretty standard functionality.,LOVE this idea and it is a daily pain for our entire staff since I have to explain the 3 things they need to have completed/input prior to entry criteria being complete. This would be a HUGE help!!!
Customizable Campaign Member Status Values picklist,Pat Willard,Under Consideration,11670,16,None,The workaround (manually adding a status to each new Campaing) does not when automating a campaing process....why is this not fixed???? Should not take 9 years....,Wouldn't it be nice.,Here's to another 9 years - cheers!,None,@Meredith Brown Summer 17 is here. I did not find anything in the release notes. Any update?,Just spent an hour trying to figure out how to do this since it seems that every campaign that's created has a slightly different set of member statuses depending on who created the campaign. We need to be able to lock in continuity and do so efficiently.,None,It is really important to default the picklist. Manjual addition of picklist value will just increase the option and will result into redundant data.,What they said.,Please add this capability - it's impossible to go into individual campaigns to add/update picklist values especially when you integrate with a external marketing system and import data in bulk into Salesforce.,Please add this- frustrating how much time we spent trying to figure out where this feature was hidden and turns out its not a capability.,Yes, please consider. This shouldnt be left to a 3rd party plugin,We need this as well. ,We need this feature for our implementation,We need this," too. Puzzled that this is considered ""Advanced"". It takes a lot of practice to get in the habit."
Add Task/Event Reminders to push notifications in Salesforce1 app,Ken B,In Development,5740,16,@Jesse Glenn - what you saw earlier this week is an early version of task notifications in Salesforce1. We inadvertently enabled the functionality in the 9.0 build, and the app update you saw later in the week reverted that enablement until we are ready for an official rollout. I'm working with the product teams now to understand the dependencies for a full roll out. Sorry for the tease. I'll be back with more details. ,one year ago and a basic push notification for your events is still missing.... this is a shame, salesforce!,Our customers need this desperatly. @Jennifer Sacks, any updates on the release schedule for this feature?,Horrible! Salesforce! Wake up! This is an essential thing that MUST BE  and can be added within a few hours by your specialist into our app. Please make it happen! ,This is needed by all of our users that are using the app,Since there was a new release of Salesforce1 this week, It would be really nice to hear from SF with a new status update.  We haven't heard anything for over a year and this item certainly gets a lot of traffic.  Frankly I'm kinda getting sick of all the emails hearing from so many others that want and need this!,Since there was a new release of Salesforce1 this week, It would be really nice to hear from SF with a new status update.  We haven't heard anything for over a year and this item certainly gets a lot of traffic.  Frankly I'm kinda getting sick of all the emails hearing from so many others that want and need this!,We have a very large mobile user based who really need the option to include a reminder notice when NOT in the application. Please advise on the status of when this will be delivered or what options are available today. Thank you. ,We have a very large mobile user based who really need the option to include a reminder notice when NOT in the application. Please advise on the status of when this will be delivered or what options are available today. Thank you. ,@Harry Mann I read your blog post, but it only included part 1. Is there a part 2? I'd like to at least figure out a workaround in the meantime if possible. It's really hard to explain to users that there are all of these different possibilities in Salesforce but not a simple reminder for their phones... especially when they are all strictly mobile.,I contacted salesforce about this today," and they had no answers for when it would be released... Just that it is ""not yet implemented""... but they just released the new version of the Salesforce1 app!! UGH!",It seems like I get a request from my users for this feature every day! Hopefully it is released soon! ,I have many users that are struggling to adopt salesforce because of this. Any update to let them know its coming soon would be wonderful.,"This feature is now marked as ""COMING IN THE NEXT RELEASE"". Would be really nice to actually hear back from someone at Salesforce", maybe give us a little more information?,None,@Jesus Mejia - The last time they posted about it was 9 months ago, and at that time they said they were aiming for an August release. They had a fully functioning beta at that time, which they inadvertently enabled. It worked perfectly fine on my device, and this was in March.
Case Comments Quick Action: Send Customer Notification,Benjamin Barniskis,Under Point Threshold,20,0
Text Area (Long) Formula support,Admin Rights Engine,Not Planned,9370,16,All, unfortunately this functionality is not currently on our roadmap. To be transparent, resources in this area have been focused on delivering our new Lightning Experience, and we still have a couple of releases to go with that project before we can start broadening our scope again. The product management team hears the demand for this and has it on the backlog to revisit once we've completed Lightning. Thank you again for the feedback. I will be sure to update this space if any new information becomes available. ,Placing priority on a shoddy slow UI instead of fixing glaring data model shortcomings is bordering on negligent. You're knowingly forcing us to needlessly duplicate data and increase risk of bad data.,Hello World,"I wouldn't mind Jennifer's comment so much if Lightning resources were being devoted to fixing these fundamentals. Instead they seem focused on building out ""cool stuff"" that they can upcharge for (and that demos well) rather than bringing Lightning up to feature parity.",Long waiting and much required in reports. NO WORKAROUND Available,At a bare minimum, we should be able to use ISBLANK or ISNULL this would be very helpful!,I would much more prefer this fixed (and other core functionality as well) than the gimmicky Lightning Experience.,This would be very helpful!,Agree with others on this thread - we shouldn't have to resort to hacks to make existing product functional. Would be nice if SF would dedicate some resources to resolving known holes in existing product.,"While I understand the need to focus on making Lightning  better...it's this sort of thing that drives me nuts about Saleforce.  This is another definite ""need / would make life much simpler"" for our organization.",This would be very useful.,None,We need this.,This is a much needed stuff. Even I am struggling with this problem.,None,@jennifer sacks - do you have any update on if/when this would be something you would add to the raodmap? It looks like this is a hot topice still and your latest salesforce comment is from a year ago. Any and all information you have would be wonderful to hear about. Thank you!
Fire a Update trigger after EmailMessage system update,David Rennert,Product Team Review,2650,15,None,None,None,None,Seems like a basic thing that should be available in the platform.,This will be very useful,This would be really helpful to us,This will be a useful feature.,This is a basic need in the application to track the unread mail and when it was read. Don't know why Salesforce is missing this basic stuffs.,This is should be very helpful for our company.,This is must to have feature and i don't why there is a limitation not to fire trigger/workflow on change of email message status.,Very disappointing that such a basic functionality is still missing in salesforce, which was reported 4 years ago. ,This functionality would really be helpful to us.,The email functionality in Salesforce is so poor that despite the official company line being, we shouldbe usng Salesforce email for everything, I am constantly unofficially telling users just to use their regular email and then update Salesforce. This is not the way it shoud be! I can see enhancements have ben made un Summer '16, but only for Lightning Experierence. Are hoe of us that stilll need to use Classic for other resons going to be left behind?,Will the Summer '16 enhanced email feature support this? https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer16/release-notes/rn_sales_productivity_email_enhanced.htm
Permission set assign to public group will save a lot of repetitive work.,Sagar Nagvekar,Under Point Threshold,40,2,I also agree that this idea would be a time saver when members of a group/team requiring specific permissions change often,We agree with this idea.  We have a public group whose members change and the permission set for the group has to be managed by users in addition.
Eliminate Need for Master-Detail Relationship for Roll-ups,jeffrey rheel,Under Consideration,34660,16,None,Salesforce please reconsider and add this functionality to the roadmap. Currently there are apps out there that can provide this service, but in a larger organization getting approval to use apps is a bit more intensive. It would make a world of difference if Salesforce could do this for us. ,Agreed this would be nice as I'm commonly wanting to roll up values from child objects to parents, even when the relationship is not master-detail.,THis would be very simple but very useful feature and I am wondering why only the opportunities  are offered as Summarised Obejcts for roll up summary fields... Please add the Contracts object as well. ,Amazed this is not yet available,Roll-up for any related object would be very helpful!,Any Idea when this feature is going to come? We need this feature ASAP,9 years and counting...,Need this!,Crazy this doesn't already exist, but this is needed.,This feature will definately eliminate writing lot of apex code. Please implement it.,very needed,This would make things so mutch better, please implement!,Man where is the lightning?,None,This would be so useful. 
MC error messages guidelines,Constanca Figueiredo,Under Point Threshold,60,0
Lightning Experience Multi-select picklist should retain values,Andrew Rucker,Under Point Threshold,260,9,We need this for our users as well.,None,Yes voting for this. So I am designing a community that would include a custom object that would have a multiselect picklist available to community users to create daily records for data we need. I understand that you can hold ctr and select multiple but what if they are viewing the community in a tablet or mobile view? How would they select multiple values?,@Emily Walton, you should be able to edit multi-select picklists using Command on the Mac! ,None,I can't even use Ctr because I have a Mac. So I guess I can't use multi-select picklists in Lightning? How can something this simple still be missing from Lightning? ,Additionally, the need to use ctrl+select to un-select is VERY unintuitive. Agree that the classic version was better. Could another option be a check box by each value?,I believe this was a miss during UI design. If you think like a customer," updating or adding a value to the ""selected"" side of the multi-select picklist is very common occurance. With the new LEX design of the multi-select", it forces users to remember all prior selections just to add one additional value to the record. That is A.) not efficient at all and B.) not possible once you have a list of prior selections over 5 values and that may be pushing it. Extremely easy to lose valuable data while performing this action. Not designed with the end user in mind. Would suggest rolling this enhancement back. ,Agreed - poor design.  VERY easy to lose valuable data!
Ability to Customize Account Hierarchy View,Brian Hopkins,Under Point Threshold,150,0
Left Justify Text in HTML Email Template,Jason Maas,Under Point Threshold,2440,15,This is essential - Our customers comment that the format looks awful,it's amazing to me that Salesforce ignores issues like this that you think would be low-hanging fruit.  But they can spend $700M building their HQ in San Francisco.  Seriously!!!,Please fix!,Yes. Yes. A thousand times... YES!,I expected a HTML-editor to have an actual HTML-editor, not just a WYSIWYG-interface. I really hope this gets above the threshhold.,None,"Thank you @RobinRoach!  Excellent suggestion! I too wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to ""Fix"" this issue only to discover I can't", SF needs to, :(,None,Please fix. 300 points short of point threshold...? oy vey.,Please fix Email templates! Very difficult to work with and lots of time wasted. ,None,None,In fact formatting an template-based HTML email has become even harder in Salesforce.  In the most recent version of the (always inadequate) editor, you now cannot even switch to view the HTML markup to make adjustments. ,None,None
"Allow ""inline"" images in email sent from SFDC",Tejas Gohel,Product Team Review,2500,15,We want to rollout out Salesforce to 50 more users. Without this functionality we will simply pick another product.,I am forced to use my Gmail to send off an email to my users (and then sync it to Salesforce) simply because I can personalise my email a whole lot more than I currently can in Salesforce. I agree with the below comment - If Gmail can do it why can't Salesforce? ,Definitely a need for so many of our potential and current customers!,Needed and behind what is realdily available elsewhere - is now an expected funtion for users and stakeholders,Great Idea and would alleviate a big pain! ,This would be very useful for all our users and admins,YES!!  When we are handling support cases, I end up having to revert back to my own email and syncing it manually because I can use inline images in my email, rather than attaching them.  It makes the process for our end-users who use emails so much more difficult, and the recipients have a harder time if there are multiple images/attachments,This would be great!,This would be a huge benefit to our customer service team when they are using cases.,If Google Mail can do it why not Salesforce?,Much needed for better email implementation ..,"My company recently implemented Salesforce and we encourage users to use Chatter rather than email to communicate information about Opportunities. Since a user cannot reply with an embedded image using the ""reply to this email""",they are forced to log in to Salesforce,save save to an off - line location the image that they would have liked to embed in the reply email,"and finally upload the saved image to the Chattter Post on the Opportunity.This is significantly more work.The bigger problem is that the users think they are successfully sharing the image via ""reply to this email""",but the image is not actually being sent.,This information could be out of date but my understanding is this is problem with the web browser technology rather than SFDC.,None,would be very useful.
Salesforce 1 and iOS 9 split screen functionality,Jeremy McDaniel,Under Point Threshold,180,7,Yes!,This would be really useful. ,Someday...,None,Mission critical addition for our organization as many of us our on the road constantly transferring data between apps. As we're just rolling out SFDC now, we'd welcome this.,SFDC is a mobile first solution, it needs to support productivity features like this one of the two biggest platforms.,This would be amazing.
Allow Workflow Tasks to be assigned to Related User,Brad Phillips,Product Team Review,7940,15,Please make this functionality possible. Currently PB is the only option to complete this and it is bulky. This needs to be rolled out ASAP.,It should be a must.,really need this. surprised it's not already there.,Yes please! I need that too,This would be incredibly useful. Can't believe it is not standard. Feel like I am missing something.,I agree,I agree!,Looking forward to this being added in the system,This would be hugely helpful,Why is this still not available? ,This would be extremely useful, workarounds exist but are inefficent. Great suggestion.,This functionality is often required to setup workflows to create tasks in Salesforce.  ,I have just accomplished this by using Process Builder. Not as simple and straight forward as a workflow but still uses only clicks and no code.,This would be very useful!,Yes please!
Customer View of their queue position in Live Agent,Kevin Sheridan,Under Point Threshold,1800,15,+1 for this!,This would be a such a positive upgrade to the lIve agent experience that I am really suprised it is still not available. ,This is a feature we have wanted to for quite some time, We constantly are struggling with abandons because customers have no idea how long they have to wait.,I think this would be an excellent feature to add.,This would be a great feature to add to chats as it has helped with the calls that come in from the ones we serve most. After reviewing the otehr comments I have to agree knowing how many calls or chats are ahead of me helps me determone how lomg  I will be waitng till my request can be resolved. The olda dage that time is money is very true as many people do not like having to wait and if they can arrange for a call back (even at a set time) or a chat when they are closer in line makes the planning better all the way around!,I look forward to seeing this new feature! It would be a game changer for our business and our customers.,Yes this would be an amazing feature!,This would be amazing for our buisness!,This is a huge! request from our customers. Our chat volume continuous to increase and we are constantly told," ""Why can't I see how many chats are waiting before me and my estimated time","so I can make a decision whether to hold or not"" Please activate this feature. ",Personally, knowing my own wait time as a customer is quite important when managing my personal time and understanding the volume of the business I'm waiting to hear from at the time. It helps me to make the decision of waiting," asking for a ""call back"" or trying back at a later", less occupied time. If you were waiting, wouldn't you want to know how long the wait is for the services required? I mean, I can figure out how long it's going to take me to get through the line at the local Deli because even they have numbering system for those in line. ,The idea for showing queue wait times has been out here for at least 4 years. Come on Salesforce, you can do this.,This would be a huge improvement for exhibitors chatting in considering they currently see a loading symbol until they are connected to an agent. It is imperative that customers know that their time is important to us. I can't remember the last time I called a customer service line and wasn't informed of my place in line and/or an estimated wait time. This feature would also improve accuracy from a reporting standpoint when looking at abandonment rates for live chat.,TSIA would consider this an absolute must have as they have defined any channel being used should have the same positive experience as any other channel of customer contact.   This is necessary too make that happen.  SInce SFDC is heavily involved in TSIA, I am a bit surprised that wait times are not a function of Chat.,This feature would make a big difference for the customer.  Not knowing how long the wait will be means that many users will drop off making the functionality of SF chat questionable at best. ,It's really unfortunate that this feature is still MIA.  For high-volume B2C support scenarios in which multiple channels are offered, it's really frustrating to watch customer experience on Live Agent tank due to long hold times whilst the IVR is thoughtfully telling listeners on the phone not just estimated wait time but also offering a queued position callback.  
Add case comments in the Lightning Experience,Henrik Helt Hansen,Under Point Threshold,1120,10,Does this also apply if you're using the case feed?  I notice Notes have a public and private option,  and we use it often.  We haven't switched to lightning yet so i'm not sure of the behavior?  Anyone know?  Thanks.,Oh... and Case History doesn't work either.  ,None,Agreed. This is a big gap and the only reason we're not moving to Lightning as well.,Seriously this is very very basic much needed functionality which is missing and it is creating a huge gap between classic and lightning. Hope we will get this feature near soon :-),The problem for us is that we have a lot of historical data in the case comments that customers now can't see on their cases. For new cases we can use the feed comments, but how do we get the existing comments into the feed?,For me personally, the feed view is too spread out so I do miss the comments which I can just see all at once, chronologically. Being able to add case comments is vital to most of our workforce.,None,Major gap and a showstopper preventing us moving to Lightning.,This is yet another reason to not switch to Lightning, customers see lightning think it looks nice and then we have to tell them about various functionality that doens't work so they would be better with classic
Live Agent - Allow notifications to be customized.,Heather McLemore,Product Team Review,2970,15,As others have said the notification sound is too quiet and the onscreen alert is too brief. It would be good if Salesforce could comment on this.,our requirement is to stay up Browser Notification a bit more. In other words, Chrome Notification popup shows only for about one Second. Our call center agents are recommending to increase duration of time when popup stays active on the screen before it disappears.,Since the latest release agents are complaining that the notification sound is barely audible.  Please allow us to have control over type of notification sound per deployment.  Our agents use different tools besides SF to answer chats, by far SF is the worst at hearing the notification, thus agents are mising chats, AHT is high.,The new update has had a big effect on our office, the sound has changed and can no longer be heard within the office, how do we get this changed back!!!,None,None,None,This would be a great feature and if done properly could offer several choices for notification sounds and the ability for the agents or companies to create their own branded sounds.  This should be a FUN feature.  Imagine ice cream truck bells or your favorite hockey goal theme song :-),None,I meant 2/10/17,The incoming chat notification was changed over 2/10/16 from a very noticable and more alarming sound to a light and chimmey sound that is not as noticable. We have missed chats because it is hard to hear now. Our chat team would love the option to customize the sound to our needs.,None,Yes, to be able to change the volume would be great!,None,We are just implementing this tool and customization of chat notification is absolutely needed.
Lightning Experience LEX - Inline editing with dependent picklists,Penny Hammond,Under Point Threshold,760,4,This idea has a direct impact on the Sales Path in LEX. Currently, when you have dependent fields on the Opportunity Stage, these fields do not show up when you use the Sales Path to close the Opportunity. Unless, the dependent fields show up as a popup or a modal window, for the user to update the dependent fields, it is impossible to use the Sales Path in LEX.,One of the limitations of how this works in classic, is that you can not control the order of the fields that display in the pop-up through a configuration feature.  Instead, it is controlled by the order in which they were originally created (or something similar).  If a modal popup is built for Lightning, it should also allow the administrator to control the layout.,We agree - this is a very useful feature.  We plan on bringing it to Lightning in the next few releases #safeHarbor,And another place it could be used - editing within related lists (when that Idea gets implemented)
"Make Sales Path button ""Mark as Current Stage"" optional",Alberto Minardi,Under Point Threshold,220,1,None
Change fonts and font size for PDF Quotes,Drew Robinson,Under Point Threshold,940,15,We need to customize the Quote and the enriched text field is not working as expected (it doesn't allow us to add colours, bold etc),None,Also - add merge fields in text sections ,None,Yes, plsssss... it's a must!,Font is too big for our notes,Much needed within Salesforce - ditto to previous comments.,Cheers to this idea. ,Really a basic functionality that is critical to be able to use the functionality.,None,None,Absolutely need this!   ,Just another example of how Salesforce is grossly overpriced and lacks such basic functionality as this, so they can sell you add-ons. Execs are so concerned with market capitalization, they lack any time to focus on functionality and customer experience. What a disappointment. ,None,Font size is too small especially after being faxed to customer side.
Live agent compatibility with lightning,Stephanie Stylianou,Under Point Threshold,570,2,None,What is the workaround that you used?
validation rule in approval process,subbiah Ganesh,Product Team Review,3680,15,Must be needed,This is a very common issue for businesses. Please implement this!,I agree that this would be useful.  It's stopping me from putting in a safeguard.,Looking for this feature at the earliest...,This would be great to have Approval Process hit the Validation Rules for an object or even build Validation Rules just for an Approval Process!,I did not realise we could not do this, would be very helpful,Much Needed .. ,This would be a very useful feature to have,Agreed, much needed.,This is a much needed feature, which is limiting the functionality of approval process.,Must needed feature. 6 Years and its still pending.. surprising!!,This is an absolute must.  Can't run approvals without it.  ,Really need this, because we need to prevent a modify all opps user to approve his own record!!,Happy to see traction and hope for a resolution soon :),Workaround: Add validation through trigger. 
"Customize ""Approve/Reject Approval Request""",Joël Denis,Product Team Review,7700,15,Just another marvellous feature we miss...,also need this feature,Need this feature.,None,We use the apporvval process on the Opprtunity where the opportunity owner can request additional discount. We would like to add in the Approval Request an edit button so the Approver can change the requested discount if he is not fully approves the full request but part. Now the approver needs to do multiple steps and clicks to have a partial approval.,Bump.,This is slightly disappointing - You would think standard approval processes would allow for more customisation in general. Would make sense that any approver could input extra data or make edits on approval rather than just comment. ,From a reporting perspective, this is a major need in customer service.,Please implement this soon,Yes indeed, 9 years and counting!  I've long since stopped wishing for this feature and just hired consultants to build it for me.  Too bad I can't share my configuration with the hundreds, or probably thousands of others that could benefit.  It's a one-off custom configuration so I get to maintain it, and now pay for maintaining it ;(,Just encountered I can't do this.. This is needed.,Wow. 9 years old? I'm not going to get my hopes up then...,I agree, ability to add custom information to help the Approval decision and a Rejection Reason picklist.,It would be a plus to include the setting in the standard menu.,It would be really valuable to put more information on the page layout for quicker approvals!
Assign the list of Delegated External User Profiles in a Permission Set,Niki Vankerk,Under Point Threshold,200,5,How come after a year Salesforce still have not fixed the issue that community plus users can be given delegated external admin rights to other contacts under their account," but the setup enhanced UI does not allow anyone to define what profiles are available which leads to an insufficient permissions error when attempting to enable the community user?  Come on Salesforce this is not an ""idea"" for something new it is a bug in the system and it should be sorted.",As Jodi pointed out it can be found in the profile page, with the 'Enable Enhanced Profile User Interface' option unchecked (from user interface menu). The weird part is that it is there in Profile page and not in the Permission sets page. Need a quick fix for this,OMG," the ""Delegated External User Profiles related list"" is not even on the ""Enhanced Profile User Interface"" you have to uncheck ""Enable Enhanced Profile User Interface"" to get to this related list. Bizarre! ",Ugh, why is this not a thing yet," expecially when the documentation specifically states ""You can also grant delegated administration rights using permission sets.""",This is something that should be in Permission Sets. +1 for this idea
Reporting on Multi-Select Picklists,Olivia,Product Team Review,7880,15,None,Very important option to have. Could do includes and allow for checkboxes for each picklist value just like a standard picklist report.,I didn't even realize this was not a feature until one of my users pointed it out! Really? WOW. Please implement!,This should be delivered years ago! Salesforce come on!!!,+1,Please please please!!,required to have more user friendly behaviour in SF,+1,9 years - 4 merged ideas: about time this gets implemented. ,None,Much Needed...,+1,Much needed. ,It's a basic requirement, certainly if you don't know the available values.,Much needed usability improvement.
Ability to export or print the report chart with the report,Andrea Ryan,In Development,6520,16,This functionality is on the roadmap, thought we don't yet have a concrete release date. We will update this space as more details become available. ,would make reporting to our customers so much easier!  Love to see it implemented!,@Jennifer Saks any updates on this feature? It's been a year. ,None,Yes, this needs to happen ASAP.  I need these reports for presentations.,Critical!  What's the point of being able to configure a report with a graph when you are unable to extract it with the report?? Would REALLY appreciate an update on this one. Thanks,This feature will definitely make many users very happy. I get this question in just about every session as many users need to capture funnel data and make this available in bigger company reviews as just one slide in, typically PPT format.,This functionality would be much appreciated!,pretty important!,Would love to see it added, especially since it tends to blur if you try to drag the corner and need it larger for a meeting.,Would LOVE to see this function added!  What's the sense of having it appear visually on the report layout, and then not be able to print it with the table?,We have this request from our users as well.,None,This is requirement that could be good to have.,Our customers need an easy way to export charts from reports and dashboards. I understand there are several workarounds but there should be a native way to export charts within Salesforce.,None
Merge Opportunity Records,Stephanie Alighieri,Product Team Review,9780,15,It would be interesting for us.,This would be a huge asset! ,Will definitly save time.,Crucial capability to save time and increase productivity,We had to build a class for this feature and it seems to work.  Still a manual process and would definitely be a great add to SFDC.,Time saver! Hope to see this soon in SFDC.,saving a lot of time in connecting the right opportunities for both Sales and marketing,When can we have it..... it would save us al lot of time.....,The option to merge opportunities would be very useful,Good function,Very Important for our indirect business with distributors !,If the goal is to make users life easier and increase adoption rates, this feature is a no brainer for Sales Force. In organizations with different teams collaborating on the same opportunity, sometimes two or more similar opportunities are created and once the opportunity is closed users have to manually transfer data and close one opportunity. Implementation should be as easy as the merge account or merge contact functions. I wonder why Sales Force is not implementing this function. ,None,None,Fundamental feature.
History Tracking for Tasks,Kristin Flewelling,Product Team Review,9300,15,it's obvious. Why this exeption? Any other object has it.,None,is this really going on for 9 years? anyone at salesforce reading this?,This is definitely needed.,This should be standard functionality.,It is definatelly needed.,An expected feature missing from Tasks, this is ridiculous.,+1.  This would be very useful,This would be extremely helpful,This feature would be very helpful. ,None,None,Much needed! At the very least, ability to track owner history:),We need this!!,None
Import Field History,Justiniano Epistola,Under Point Threshold,110,4,We are migrating from a different salesforce org and now we are losing all of our field history for all of our objects because we cannot get the field history put into the new org.   Very disappointing.  ,Please add this!,None,This is especially useful when you acquire another company or are onboarding to salesforce to begin with.  I would also ask that this be possible for the trending history tables as that's what many people ask for.  E.g. Opportunity__hd
Process Builder: Evaluate Assignment Rules for New Records,Rachel Kjos,Product Team Review,2800,16,None,Please evaluate case management rules when Case records are inserted from Process Builder. Thanks,Essential functionality. This is one of several reasons that we do not use Process Builder.,Being that that the omni-channel widget doesn't route cases created by process builder or updated by workflow rules, if process builder evaluated assignment rules after the case is created, this would help route cases to an Omni-Channel queue and out to agents. Since process builder does not evaluate or trigger assignment rules, additional workarounds and queue checks have to be in place to check to see if any cases are in the queue for distribution from the process builder.,This makes it difficult to automate notifications about case queues that are being assigned new records created via email-to-case. Results in a significant amount of time being used to constantly check the queue.,None,Just discovered this functionality doesn't exist......seems as if it should....,None,Like HBX SFDC said: please do the needful.,This is very needed when using Case to direct internal team's workflow around a business process. Since tasks cannot be assigned to a queue (see the other idea that's 6+  years old and 25,000 points...) - Case is the only option when multiple teams need to coordinate and complete their steps in sequential order. I can easily create a process to create the case based on criteria, but if I can't assign it to the right queue using native assignment rule functionality - there's not much point. ,This is needed for the lead assignment rule, also. If I edit a lead manually," I can invoke the ""Assign using active assignment rule"" thing via checkbox. We need to be able to invoke that in Process Builder.",+1,Please do the needful.,None,Could use this feature,Need a way to trigger lead or case assignment on insert or update.
Lightning Experience LEX - lightning speed please!,Penny Hammond,Product Team Review,14240,16,None,So I just logged into SF and it looks like it's now Summer 17 release.  Might just be in my head but it honestly feels 2x faster now, pretty much like Classic.  Not sure if it's just the weekend and less users online or something but it seems better!,None,Saving a new record or changes to a record in Lightning are far too slow for busy sales users in Summer 17. ,It would be nice if the Lightning experience was as quick as it shows it is in the videos on their Youtube channel ;D,I allowed some of my users to use the Lightning Experience and wish I had never done it.  The speed issue is killing me.  ,still slow in summer 17 when not in incognito mode,This is rough.  I am currently implementing a new instance of SF for a company.  I decided to deploy and train on LEX so I wouldn't have to 're-train' down the road.   Can't say I made the right choice.   I can deal with bugs, but the snail's pace is oppressive.  ,This needs an update from the product team. Been over 4 months.,None,None,Just wanted to say the same thing.  I'm on a trial for SF but Lightning is way too slow to use daily.  It's not terrible, no where as slow as Dynamics but compared to Classic it's a huge difference.  I can whip around Classic so fast doing things, but Lightning feels very bloated almost.  Classic you double click a field and on the 2nd click it is in edit mode.  Lightning you double click, wait 2-3 secs for the field to change to editable, make your change then save.  It's by no means awful but it's way slower than Classic.  I'll maybe reconsider once it is more polished, as I'm finding so many areas where things just aren't supported in Lightning, like product schedules.,None,None,None,None
Criteria Based Sharing rules: Allow Lookup/formula/dynamic values and user field,Kuldeep Tyagi,Product Team Review,8460,15,We need this kind of feature ASAP!,We need this feature!,Grat idea,Definitely needed - as it stands, there's no easy way to control access after a certain amount of time has passed - I need to waste a workflow rule to update a number field to duplicate the value already in a forumla field.  Crazy.,Yes. This would be helpful.,Would be great. Right now we could use ability to share via lookup fields to avoid APEX sharing.,Please add the functionality to include a user lookup field as a way to share a record with users!!!,I need to create a sharing rule based on a formula field on my opportunities.,I have a business requirement currently to base an opportunity sharing rule off of a formula derived from the associated Account. This formula puts our Opportunities in regional buckets. If I cannot use this field, I cannot fulfill this requirement.,Yes," this is required and common occuring scenario. Imagine we have multiple roles in the organiation and if a record created by a user under a specific role has to be shared with all the team members with in that role and if this scenario gets repetitive for all roles present in the organization then we end up writing sharing rules for all roles present in our organization. It will be easier if this is dynamic meaning some thing like ""for each user in role share record with all others users maching the same role.""",This is needed both to make life easier - and more secure!,I think this feature is definitely required.,This would be great as a general functionality, i built a workaround via a process invoking a flow to create the sharing record. ,This is really required. We need formula fields to be used in Sharing Rules such that we can do the sharing based on dynamic calculation. Because of this drawback, we need to do lot of customizations.,This will make life little easy!

Allow Admins to edit the Related To field on the Task or Event to only objects t,Sheila McEvoy,Product Team Review,2540,15,The list should be editable in order to put the most used items first, then an alpha sort.,Hi there, need to reduce this list for a client down to 3 options, to prevent most users from having to scroll down the whole list everytime. Please help. thanks, Nicola,We want Related To field customizeable as well.  Often I don't like the default lookup that is listed or want to limit what employees can use to 1 or 2 lookups.  This would save clicks and limit mistakes.,None,Really hard to work with.,"Our internal workflow includes one requiring task to be related to an internal user. The ""Related To"" field does not allow us to add User to its lookup table so it breaks our workflow.",Frustrating to see other objects show up here from managed packages too.,Yes, it will be really useful.,I can't imagine this not coming standard, nor having to scroll through 6 years of complaints and requests to even find an update regarding this topic. This is absolutely essential. Is there a solution yet?,I'm very surprised by this limitation. It's a section that definitely should be customisable to suit companies individual needs. Surely this is a no brainer?? Hopefully this change will be made in the near future. ,None,"Does anyone know when we will be able to edit the ""Related To"" lookup filter on the Events object? ",None,"My instance is Platform and my users have no idea what ""Opportunity"" means -- so not having the ability to set the default of the Related To field is a huge hassle. ",Also agree. Task needs to be more flexible. They have to much restrictions.
Lead & Contact Report,Holly Ford,Under Consideration,7380,16,Thank you for your continued feedback on this feature.  We've started to explore combing leads and contacts on list views and reports, but the work is not currently planned for the next 2 releases. ,Our Marketing dept really needs this!,This report is the bane of marketing and sales reports. Please fix soon!,Agree that a report type for  Campaigns + Leads + Contacts will really help,Any update on this idea? With the increase in marketing automation, this feels like it ought to, at least, be on the roadmap in the new few releases.,Wow.. 6 years!  A report type for  Campaigns + Leads + Contacts will really help !!! ,I have been a demand gen user of SFDC for 4 years now and the lack of this feature has been killing me every. single. day.  so much effort and time wasted to pull separate reports...  Just prioritise it asap please...,It's ridiculous that you cannot pull a report of all PEOPLE (leads + contacts). It just creates more work for the user to combine report exports outside of salesforce.,Please. Start. This kills every single rep in my company every day.,I too am keen to know when this feature is availble as it would make life so much easier.,This is stupid that this isn't a feature already. This is a MUST HAVE feature. Any updates? It has to have been at least 2 releases since your post. ,Hi Meredith - Do you have an update on this?,add the functionality already,None,Crazy that this doesn't exist. So inefficient.,This would be so helpful for us to know where our Lead Gen population is......
HTML Email Status Custom Report Type,Paul (PJ) Jordan,Under Point Threshold,190,6,This would help us a ton!,This would be a great addition,I concur.  We need this functionality.  ,Great Idea!  This would be very helpful.,None,You have my vote! Great idea that would benefit lots of salespeople.
Show all reports that use a specific field,Jeanne Flatland,Under Point Threshold,1120,15,1 Billion percent useful as the alternative is to manually go through every single report.  In a company with 300-500 people, that's nearly impossible for an admin or even team of admins.,This would be fantastic!,This would be very useful!,This would make the life easier to administrate reports !,This would be awesome!,Agree, this would be so useful!,This would be great,It would be graet to have this in Salesforce UI.,This would be so useful!,YES!,yes!,This features is surely requied.,tomorrow... that would be great.,Yes, please!,This is essential if you are implementing State & Country Picklists," as the ""Scan"" provided does NOT help with knowing which reports actually need to be edited."

validation rule to prevent delete record,Eric Stephenson,Under Point Threshold,1700,15,None,Great idea, Will be very useful.,Definitely a valid usecase.,This would be so useful and negate the need to use triggers,Great idea.,Needed. Trigger means code.,Great idea, Really need to handle delete by particular users or owner of record.,Another opportunity to empower Admins to handle a simple need declaratively rather than waiting for a developer resource to be available.,+1, it's a great idea,Or at least allow us to remoe the delete action from the related list. ,+1,This will be highly valuable so we do not have to write a trigger for this obvious use case,This would be a great feature,Yes, Please!,Concur.
Onclick Javascript Buttons with Lightning Experience,Dan Boudreau,Product Team Review,10740,16,None,This is a must have. I can't beleive they didn't transfer this over from classic. ,None,This would greatly benefit us.,None,None,None,Yes, we need this,When our org was built by consultants 3 years ago," they created many onclick js buttons that will have to eventually ""go away"" and somehow be replaced if we can't continue to use them.  Most of them call a global webservice in our org that contains various apex methods.  When one of these buttons is clicked"," it goes to the webservice and calls code that needs to ""do something""",such as check values in a related list andthrow an error if certain ones aren't found, check fields in the controlling record and throw an error if certain data has not been entered, etc.Sometimes it's necessary to do it this way because a validation rule can't always handle complex conditions on whether to throw an error or not.This is a big use case for us and we need it to stay.,@Ben Davis, yes you are right, I must have misread that part, thanks! Still i'm a bit puzzled why SF classic is moving away from javascript formula fields, promote javascript buttons, but lightning on its turn is moving away from javascript buttons, promoting quick actions. A universal approach would benefit both versions of salesforce.,@Paul Fris, the article you linked doesnt support what you said.  It said hyperlink formula fields cant contain java, not Custom Buttons, which is what this idea is about.  In fact they specifically encourage you to make a custom button for OnClick Java script while saying it will only work in classic.  I still would like them to implement javascript buttons in lightning as otherwise my group is going to be spending a months re-coding items.,None,This will help us alot... Please...,This is important and need to be fixed.,None,None
Matrix Report Sorts by Grand Total,Richard Zupan,Product Team Review,3860,15,This would be a great functionality to have, as at the moment we have to export it to Excel and sort there, simply because we have it grouped by 2 groups!,I would say yes this is a very important feature, this was raised 6 years ago Salesforce! :),Surprised that it is something that is not available in report as yet?,Very obvious need,We just switched over to Salesforce and assumed that this functionality would be included in the software.  Please fix this issue soon as our Sales Managers rely on this data on a daily basis.,This would be a valuable workaround in some instances for the row limitations on the printable view...unless that gets improved.  ,Salesforce is so behind...,And we need to be able to display the matrix reports in the dashboard. It is disappointing that the dashboards in Salesforce are so limited.,This is a major limitation in the eyes of Sales Leadership compared to Business Objects as we just switched daily Sales Reporting over to Salesforce and the matrix view is widely used format.,Very important feature please add! :) ,Yes! This is definatelly needed.  ,Super important. Thanks! ,Wow, I guess a lot of people have been wanting this much longer than I have, but it is definitely important and surpringing it isn't avail. ,this is so basic, amazing it's not done yet. A must! ,It is important to be able to present the information in the proper order.  Nobody wants to export details to excel and then try to re-group and sort that way.

Each user can customize their settings accordingly once the functionality is enabled for the organization by the admin. That way", an admin can have a simple process document that gets sent to new employees and the admin doesn't have to do anything else. ,None,None,None,whre is it??,None,Really regretting my year long purchase of SalesForce.  Email and Calendar sync were the two most important features I was looking for in a new CRM and I was told by my sales rep that what I was purchasing included both.  Wrong.  ,How is this not native functionality, yet? ,"I 100% agree that salesforce should have simple tools like this to make people syncing their calenders easier. Using another ""addon"" with an additional user fee is not the correct answer. Having tools like this makes salesforce a better option with more features under the hood especailly for the money customers are paying for the service. ",Is anyone evaluating this feature requirement? It will be easy to automate reminders, key event dates for customers if they can sync it with Google calendar. Waiting for an update.,INDISPENSABILE !!! non può essere una opsione.,None
Allow mass update of the Receive Approval Request Emails field on the User,James Goerke,Product Team Review,2640,15,Need to update this in bulk.,We have 5500 users to change... mass update via the api would be of some help here...,How is this not available?! Absolutely needed. ,need this functionality to support business process.,Would greatly benefit from this. ,I need this today, since its not here I will need to go through a long list of users and update them manually... Upvoted!,Needed!,Much needed..,I second that motion !,Imagine someone doing this for 1600 production users.. yes we are in that situation as I type this. :(,I second that motion !,It would be nice to have this functionality.  Also, how do you set the default picklist value for 'Receive Approval Request Emails'?,This is very much required feature and hope to see it soon in Salesforce. ,This setting should be mass updatable, and it should also be accessible via the API, Apex, Validation Rules, Workflow Rules, etc.  If it cannot be done as a custom field, then at least it should be available through some other api object so it can be accessible programmatically.,What possible reason could there be for this one field to not be accessible by API?

It is confusing when we have to explain why a custom button cannot be added when there are buttons like New exist on the tab view,None,Yes we need this feature too. Any idea when will we be able to add a Custom button in the Recent's List view?,None,Yes. Need this functionality...,Please, allow this.  This is a huge piece of missing functionality that limits our ability to tailor our UX,Excellent idea.  When we implement custom forms to take our users to different layouts for different types of accounts we would love to be able to add the buttons here that would take them there.,Strange ! its not there.,Stunned and frustrated that this isn't already available,It would be very helpful if I could add my custom Search button and custom like just like account page has reports and tools,It will be helpful if we can add custom buttons to tab view
Allow page layouts to display fields from related objects,guest,Product Team Review,20110,16,None,It would be nice to not have to create custom fields to accommodate this.,I would need to show Bookings(Custom object) fields on case page layouts. Would be good to see this idea delievered.,I think it is already said but formula fields, up to 10 levels.,None,None,This would make life so much easier if this was implemented. These formula fields are killing me. ,It would be very useful to be able to access fields from related objects without having to create formula fields,It is a shame to create so many formula fields when this could be accomplished natively.  Would love to see this implemented! :),been under product management review for some time now! In our org managing fields has become increasingly important and being able to consider fields across all objects would allow for a much cleaner data model. I hope this moves beyond review and into planning at some point:),None,I've been fighting with this for a day now, so now I find out it's not possible. It would be really good if you could display fields from 1 custom object to another custom object.,Formula field... done.,None,Other leading CRM systems have had this as a native feature for years. And you don't have to modify the data model to achieve this configuration of the presentation (by creating a formula field). Wow!,Any update Saleforce?  This is an important capability gap that needs to be closed!
Add scheduled run function for joined reports,Faith Haynes,In Development,6110,16,None,Has anything happened with this? Last response was 2 years ago??,I believe this idea maybe stuck in limbo.  I just emailed Kristie and her email address bounced at Salesforce.  After further investigation, she is no longer at Salesforce.  :-(,We either need this functionality so that Joined Reports can be scheduled and sent to business end user recipients or we need Joined Reports to be available in Lighting to view and or export.

Make currency exchange rates available in formulas,ErikM,Product Team Review,3680,15,needed,+1,None,Exchange rates are just fields and should be available - not be secret salesforce business.  ,None,We are struggling with this issue as well, since we need to use ACM in order for our finance team to invoice in Yen, however our Commissions program pays out in USD!  Our Opptys utilize ACM and Yen displays, based on USD to Yen conversion, but now I need to create a separate formula field on the Product Line Items to convert Yen, BACK to USD for mapping....It's a nightmare because you can't reference the currency you are using for Corporate Currency ANYWHERE and magic Converted field that SF displays isn't actually a system field that can be used anywhere.  Helpful visually while in SF, but useless everywhere else. ,Sample solution available @ http://how2salesforce.blogspot.nl/,You might be interested in this idea as well: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000cNTxQAM,9 years & counting....,+1,+1,+1,+1,I am also looking same thing...,Any update from the product team on this? 
Frequency Reports from Multi-Select Picklists,KML,Product Team Review,13010,16,Hi all, this Idea is under consideration for the future, but not on the short term roadmap as we dedicate focus to Lightning.,This feature would be very useful for my organization.,Princeton Innovators has just launched a new app that provides Matrix Reporting Support for Standard Salesforce Multi-Select Picklists - http://bit.ly/pimsp. If it works well for you, please give it a thumbs up in the AppExchange Listing Reviews section. Thanks!,It's absolutely insane to me that this has been set aside for 10 years.  I understand that there may be dev work involved, but this is a serious hurdle to usability for a lot of people," and it's unfathomable to me that it's simply being ignored.  I work in tech - ""under consideration"" means you have no plans to work on making it happen.  So I ask why?  Why is this functionality available to use if it isn't available to report on accurately?",Absolutely should be available as soon as possible (in both classic and lightning).,We had a request for this today ... which is why I am out here looking for a fix!  Please impelent this.,Wow - I can't believe this isn't on the short-term roadmap - in lieu of Lightning?  Does that mean this will be included in a Lightning delivery?  This is an ask from our user base - as much as possible," we try to steer clear of custom solutions for things that just ""ought"" to be part of the base offering.  We can keep our users at bay if we can indicate it's coming in the xxx release...  Please get this on your roadmap soon!",This is so frustrating. I was not aware of this limitation (because it's so ridiculously un-intuitive) in reporting and am now facing the loss of a ton of data in multi-picklist order to conver the fields to a reportable format. FIX THIS. ,None,It's pretty astounding that Salesforce doesn't prioritze the need of reporting around Multi-Select Picklists.  People have been asking for this feature for over a decade and the fact that it isn't on your short-term roadmap to implement shows a company that is pretty out of touch with its userbase.,Having this feature will reduce the work around of choosing alternative methods for reporting purpose. ,Hi all, this Idea is under consideration for the future, but not on the short term roadmap as we dedicate focus to Lightning.,Being able to group by the individual values select in the Mult-picklist would be valuable.  Instead, many of us are forced to write triggers, VF reports, or export the data and manipulate via Excel.  ,Any chance of an up date from Product Management?  It has been 3 years since the last...,This would be a huge win for reporting data in multi-select picklists!!,This is needed to report on the Multi picklist values
Make Record Type Name available in Process Builder,Chris Duncan,Product Team Review,3850,15,Much needed. We dont want to rely on the record type Name.,None,would be really useful - I just hard coded ID,We need to access in process builder!,This is really needed. Please deliver ASAP!,common use case,@Jeremiah - nice solution. Would still be preferable to be able to do this in one step in the Process Builder rather than having to create both a Flow and a calling Process.,None,None,None,None,Much esier for maintanance as well! ,I use Process Builder on a regular basis and build out prototypes in sandboxes to get approval from my IT team before moving it in to Prod. We really don't like using Record Ids, so being able to use the name would be very helpful.,We need it absolutly !,Much needed. Makes releases and maintenance easy.
"Flow Designer needs a simple way to ""end"" a flow by navigating to a record",JP Seabury,Product Team Review,5790,16,Hi Everyone- this Idea recently passed the point threshold and has been sent to our Product team for review. We'll circle back with an update as soon as we have more to share.,I am using a flow that is triggered by a custom button URL on a detail page. I would like to leave the user on the updated version of the same detail page upon completion of flow.,This would be very useful, especially to be able to leave user at a newly created record.,None,This would be very helpful in Salesforce Platform ,I'm again surprised by this, I now have a button that ends with Your Flow Ended - no navigation at all. Why do I have to code this button so it ends reasonably. ,It's been a year since the last update - can we get some insight on if/when this much needed element will be delivered?,"This is so necessary it's not even funny. Why there is no ""End Flow"" element already is beyond me. ",I'm joining the pack in voting for this one. It's not a clean user experience to create the new record on a separate object (by clicking a button), only to refresh the page and have to find the link in a lookup field or related list. A refresh on the new record would be ideal.,any news on this topic?,We host most of our flows in VF pages and would like to start our transition to LEX. Lightning Runtime for Flows provides a way forward but not without an ability to determine the finish location within the flow itself. ,"This is very much needed. You can't have the flow redirected to the SF home page for example. it has to be VF page using ""FinishLocation"" attribute.",Any update on this?,None,Sorry, but mayor shortcoming from my perspective. Hope its coming soon.,So it's been a year sice this passed the threshold point and no resolution or update. This is very much needed!
Get a list of Hyperlink Formula Fields with JavaScript,Site Admin,Under Point Threshold,200,5,None,None,None,James this are custom fields.   You need to look in every object fields, formula fields,  enter the formula field you will have a formula that includes HYPERLINK.   If you have a lot of custom formula fields you can use the app easydescribed or Force IDE and do a search for fields type formula or Url.,None
Record the number of direct replies from a Pardot sent email,Nate Kristy,Under Point Threshold,1170,7,None,This would be really useful for Pardot as then you could see how well your emails were working! ,"A feature which tracks the ""reply"" by having a connectivity in Salesforce.com under the campaign set up of ""Responded"" would be very good for analytics of certain specific types of campaigns"," where the email goes our from an ""assigned user"" rather than a general email. ","I love the idea of being able to track direct replies from a Pardot sent email to either the ""from"" or ""custom reply-to"" email addresses.",This is particularly needed for Salesforce Engage. Other comparable products have reply tracking built in, including in reporting. We need replies as a metric in the Pardot Engage reports.,It seems odd that Pardot doesn't have built-in reply tracking as Pardot employees preach personalization and starting conversations via email, getting away from the typical graphical marketing email style that has been popular since email marketing began. A reply to a personal email can say even more about a prospect's intent than a click can.,It's unfortunate that the 299 votes from the Pardot Idea Exchange do not appear to have been migrated over to the SFDC Success Community: http://ideas.pardot.com/forums/36996-ideas/suggestions/2560330-track-record-the-number-of-direct-replies-to-sende
Ability to PRINT Dashboards,Amanda Cawthorn,Under Consideration,38270,16,Hi all, we are working on completely revamping the way we schedule reports and dashboards in Lightning. Our first step is to provide scheduling of reports and dashboards through email and after that we are going to focus on scheduling & saving reports/dashboards to PDF and Excel. Our current plan is to deliver it in mid next year (2017). Thank you for your patience. ,Will this be delivered in 2017?,This is going to be amazing. I can see so many ways to take advantage of the same.,None,None,Please add this feature to Classic,None,This feature would be so useful.  i am asked to print dashboards on a quarterly basis! ASAP please,Definately a useful enhancement.,Crazy we can't distribute in any way at the moment, please work quickly :),Hi all, we are working on completely revamping the way we schedule reports and dashboards in Lightning. Our first step is to provide scheduling of reports and dashboards through email and after that we are going to focus on scheduling & saving reports/dashboards to PDF and Excel. Our current plan is to deliver it in mid next year (2017). Thank you for your patience. ,Any update on this idea?  Customers really can use this feature...,This would be great to have.,Download Dashboard to PDF file and also print friendly version helps users on day to day activities. As dashboards becomes mostly the discussion points for various meetings.,With over 3000 users in our org, this basic print/pdf dashboard functionality is a must. Our company is heavily focus on visual  boards to drive performance and customers health check.

Customize Lightning Homepage Assistant,Shannon Parish,Under Point Threshold,40,0
Integrate ability to send surveys after a case is closed,Richard Cruz,Under Consideration,8950,16,None,Ok Michal, but it's to do that you have to install a external plugin or create your custom object to track all surveys. I Believe that salesforce should consider this as a core functionality. with all objects and tracking ready.,You can use workflow and process builder for that! ,This should be part of the core, all other CRM that I worked before had this functionality (like ZenDesk). ,This is the common requireemnt where customer wants to capture feedback when case has been closed, including this in your offerling will help immensly. ,This feature would realy required ASAP which will reduce external license cost and lot of customization.,Really valuable to incorporate this into Salesforce Servicecloud,None,We've been using Clicktools for years to accomplish this.,None,Yes this is a very good idea. We need it in Salesforce!,None,None,None,None,None
Include pick list values in search,new dev,Product Team Review,3210,15,This would be a great improvement.,None,I didn't mean just county but ANY picklist items. We need ability to search on them.  TY!!,Please add this. County search would be very helpful in our work!!,We need this! Please add it!,Salesforce, Seriously! What's the point of these voting systems if you never seem to respond. This is a major search issue and a basic search function these days. Please make the fix happen!,Really needs to happen! My sales team often dont know what the product name is when they search so need to search by product family values,This seems like a really important functionality.  It is really frustrating that I cannot search picklist values.,What the what. That this isn't a thing is crazy. Needs to happen. ,None,After working in SF for a few months I am astounded at how many seemingly no brainer features like this don't exist. How in the world SFDC has secured such a large user base is beyond me. I can't wait to get off of this platform. It's clear that SF is 90% about selling and 10% about actually delivering usable software.,Excellent idea. Definitely worth having this feature.,Please do this. The need is so obvious,Good luck with this fix :(,"This is such a MAJOR issue Salesforce. Look in this day in age global search ""aka Google"" style is the expection. Not being able to search picklists is a major troublesome deficiency. We just built out a lightning based app for one of the top 10 Medical Providers in the USA and are encountering all sorts of nonsense such as this. Of course", considering the speed with which other major shortcomings (like ability to picklist past calendar dates), I'm hardpressed to imaging SF actually fixing this. Searching Picklists is standard procedure these days - get on the fix!
Default Values on Standard Fields,Alex Sutherland,Product Team Review,7860,16,A good workaround is using workflow field updates (EE and UE customers).You can have the rule fire if the field is blank upon create to set the default value.,Still very much needed...,Completely agree. No one ever uses the Salesforce standard fields the way they are,Would help massively with usability, we are always being told to where possible use standard Salesforce functionality rather than go custom to ensure future compatability. Please update on progress.,The work-around of using a workflow rule does not work on required fields so this is definitely something that is needed. ,Default value for Due Date field on a Task record would not only be awesome IT'S FREAKING NECESSARY!,This is another must have functionality which should be standard, but which seems never to be delivered.... Sometimes I'm frustrated to see that on the one side Salesforce comes up with so called innovative and fancy things like ligthning, einstein... where on the other side they're not able to deliver basic, but very important things like this in a timely manner - this is 10 years old and desperately needed !!! ,We need to default the Quantity field for the Quote Line Item. We ned this, ,10 years!!! This is just not acceptable... Product Team, can you please update the status on this idea?,None,Correct me if I'm wrong," the ""good workaround"" suggested from John above does not work.  Due Date is not an option when using Field Updates.  ",None,10 years ago, what a joke - if only people searched these forums before choosing sfdc.,Unbelievable this isn't an option.  What if the user selects another stage that kicks off a VR?   VERY CONFUSING for new users!!,Can't believe this option is still not in place. I want to pre-populate Opportunity Name field. It's mandatory field and can't default also with random value. For simple thing, how frustrating it is to go for a Visualforce page.!!,None
Clone - Ability to Control Which Fields are Cloned,Mike Arthur,Product Team Review,5510,16,You can use the clone method with Force.com code and create a custom button to achieve the same result.http: //www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_methods_system_SObject.htm Making this standard in the app would be difficult since so many of our customers have 100 s of custom fields on these objects and I assume admins would also want the flexibility to set these based on profile and record type.,"I don't think the ""closure category"" should be included in cloning of a CR record.",None,It would replace a very critical apex trigger in our org. ,This will allow to take configuration first approach instead of using custom buttons.,Need to clone without several fields that reference outside systems.  Please consider.,None,The Javascript button issue is the reason we will not be migrating to Lightning anytime soon. Definitely post 2018.,The only reasonable solution (workaround) I've seen involves a javascript button. Now that javascript buttons are no longer available (in Lightning), I'm back to being out of options. +1,None,This limits our use with Remedyforce and is a must have,This is a much needed functionality. Please consider implement it.,None,Agreed . I need to clone without several fields that indicate access to outside systems.  Please consider!,Not only do we need the ability to exclude certain fields from Clone, we also need to be able to clone fields that are not on page layouts. The standard Clone functionality only copies data in fields that are visible to the user on the page layout. We have tons of information being stored behind the scenes that is not being captured in the Clone because the cloning user doesn't have the fields on their page layouts.,Might be technically challenging to accomplish, but it's still a great idea.  It would save your customers from having to do a lot of custom development (if my organization is typical, each object seems to have a different set of requirements for cloning!)
Edit the Recently Viewed view?,Okana Support Admin,Product Team Review,8990,16,None,We also need to remove user access to this view ,I really need to be able to hide the case owner alias and priority fields. I don't need those shown to the community customers. It shows the Recently Viewed list that shows up on the Tab page but it's confusing and frustrating that the other list shows up, isn't editable, can't be hidden, and exposes things we don't need our customers to see. ,We need an option to customize the recent view. I have a requirement wherein I want to remove New button from the recent view which is not possible today unless I take out Create permission on object.,This is a must and not of much value if not allowed to edit the columns atleast.,What is the estimated time frame to get this improvement completed?  It has been open for nearly 10 years. ,Being able to edit or hide the recently viewed list is a must!,We absolutely need to either delete/hide Recently Viewed List Views or ability to edit them. ,@Natasha . Just in case. I read in the Spring 17 release coming up this weekend (our org) that Napili, Koa, Kokua templates are no longer supported as of spring 17. See top of page 262. I don't use communities but just read your comment. HTH's.,None,"Time to make ""Recently Viewed"" list views editable now", or hide them or replace them with another list view ...,None,Much Need Now ... ,None,Please do this, not being able to sort contacts seems very simple of a fix and is surely essential in my particular business.  Seems absurd this isn't a standard preset.,What we would like to see is that when you click on the opportunities tab that the landing page has only open opportunities on it. Seems trivial because we created a view with only open opportunies but it would just be our preference to make things a little smoother on our end. 
Report for Custom Fields & Objects,Mike Bushinski,Under Point Threshold,2450,15,Great idea.,Yes!  Would be so helpful. ,Being able to pull a report of custom fiels + descriptions would be an immense help in gaining full understanding of an established org + help with future development,Yes,Yes, this is something that is truly needed!,Gotta make this happen!,Much needed feature!,This would be extremely helpful.,I could use this daily.  Meaning, every single day.,YES!,I 176th this! :),This would allow us to be much more efficient!,Definitely needed in Salesforce!,None,Please :) !!!
Lightning Experience should display archived activities,Rhonda Ross,Product Team Review,3540,16,We're actively working on this. We should have a solution within the next 3 releases (possibly sooner - I'll update this as I know a definitive release). #forwardLookingStatementApplies,Need ASAP for sales support team!,Please get this fixed! We have very long sales cycles and some of our contracts can be three years long. We need to be able to track communication activity back at least 3 years if not longer. Thanks!,This is VERY IMPORTANT in our business, as well!,Our sales cycle can exceed a year by far. This is critical. ,Critical for our organization and a real slowdown at the moment.,We're actively working on this. We should have a solution within the next 3 releases (possibly sooner - I'll update this as I know a definitive release). #forwardLookingStatementApplies,This is critical to our organization.,In certain industries with very long sales cycles (years) served by Salesforce, the concept of 'archived activities' is fine for reporting, e.g. going back only 1 or 2 years, but to not show the full history of all activities on a given Account or Contact record is a major shortcoming.  On a related note, ideally a user could see not only all activities but the full set of notes of each of those activities all in one view (e.g. similar to the 'View All' feature for activities in Salesforce Classic).,with Financial Services Cloud, developed in Lightning, it is a must have for our advisors to know history beyond one year for our clients.  Please add this functionality to Lightning.,Sorry, it works in classic and not in lightning.,What the hell is going on, thats a must, it also works in lightning and all of our customers needs this,None,Internal sales needs to see all previous activities for customer/accounts. This is the history of the customer/company and what had been discussed in the past.,Critical issue for us - we need a full view on our customer data !,I also agree this is critical. We rely heavily on activity history within accounts and contacts. Only being able to view the last 365 days is not nearly enough as we often need to reference data that antedates 1 year ago. 
Provide the ability to set column width on report columns,Adam Clark,Under Consideration,8390,16,Hi all, we are working on a new Lightning Report Builder and setting column width will be part of that. It is on our short-term roadmap to have a pilot in place.,Any update on this initiative?,Also need this in Salesforce Classic!,It would be great!! I also want to set column width on report columns.,This is common, should be delivered years ago! ,None,Vote yes for being able to modify column widths in standard reporting.,Also, Joined Reports aren't availablem in Lightning so this won't solve for all report types.,Somebody else asked about this as well, what about the Classic Users?,Great.  What about SalesForce Classic customers? ,None,The sooner, the better!  Thanks.,Hi all, we are working on a new Lightning Report Builder and setting column width will be part of that. It is on our short-term roadmap to have a pilot in place.,None,'Salesforce Success Community' - A community that Salesforce don't give a hoot about. ,Hoping to have a solution to this soon? Please advise on eta, thanks!
Mobile friendly Live Agent for reps,Chad Hester,Under Point Threshold,50,1,This would be a great option for customers on the go.
Where is this field used (page layout or formula),Jane Isaac,Under Consideration,30540,16,All, as you point out, we are long overdue for an update here. Last year we implemented a set of new thresholds to guarantee responses to popular ideas, but it looks like this one was missed. We owe you a sincere apology for that. While it has been quiet here, the product teams have definitely been reviewing and discussing this request. In the spirit of transperancy, this is not currently on the short term roadmap. We definitely recognize the value that this type of functionality would bring and have it on our longterm roadmap to deliver (safe harbor, of course). We have a few priority items we need to deliver beforehand, so this will be a few releases out. I know this isn't the ideal answer, but we will update this space as more information becomes available. ,None,None,None,None,None,None,Must need! Will be very helpful when it comes to cleaning the org.,None,This would especially come in handy when I need to clean-up a vast number of fields that are no longer needed or no longer used and are not on any page layout. ,@JenniferSacks - Anyupdate on this from Salesforce? It's been a year. I have been a Salesforce Admin since 2006 and I cannot tell you how much this feature would have helped over all these years! PLEASE look at this one and the one about automatically adding new fields to Custom Report Types! WE do what we are asked by adding these IDEAS, but they seem to just go intoa Black Hole.  We need some action now!,Thanks Ravi!!,None,None,None,None
Filters for individual dashboard components,Brian Forster,Product Team Review,3360,15,Could help indeed. The number of duplicate reports I have to create is disturbing and time-consuming. ,Also, a short term solution would be to let us omit individual components from the filters. This would allow you to have dashboards filtered for individuals that still contained team data. For example, I could calculate a rep's closed/won in one component and have the team closed/won in a second component. ,This would save so much duplication! Please release this functionality,I feel this is required to provide filter for a single component as we can put data from multiple objects into one dashboards. This feature will make reporting easier and efficient.,Absolutely a must have. Ideally a simple tabular report would drive several dashboard component angles of the data, similar to pivot charts. ,This is absolutely necessary. I am having to triplicate my dashboards and consequently using up our available dynamic dashboards very quickly.,It would also be awesome if dashboard filters could have dependencies. ,up voting.... I can't merge two dashboards because of this non existing feature,Absolutely needed!,this will be very helpful, Please share the ETA. thanks!,This feature would make dashboards more user friendly. Avoids having multiple dashboard. Highly recommend this feature from SFDC to be enabled  for us.,Very very useful. Please give us the option.,Very very useful. Please give us the option.,This would definately help !!!!,This would be REALLY helpful! I rarely have the same field available to filter on across all components.
"Add ""Switch"" or ""Case"" Statement to Apex",Dennis Perkinson,In Development,15240,16,The new compiler is nearly complete. Our intention is to release it early next year. You'll see this feature and a lot of other nice ones then. Please be patient...making a modern compiler that does exactly what an ancient compiler does is hard work!,They mentioned during a session at the last Dreamforce that Switch/Case statements apparently aren't possible in the current compiler, so don't expect this until the new one rolls out (which they also said is happening very slowly, org by org or something.),and another year passes by....,How has this not been implemented yet? I could use this feature.,As an IT Manager for a small/medium sized company I have way more things to do than develop work arounds for an application/system that I am paying hundreds of dollars a year for.  I want to pay for an application that works," has support that can actually understand what my issue is and help to resolve it ( I also pay for Premier Support) and that works in MY time zone. (US Central). I still say that Salesforce needs to listen to what the CUSTOMERS are asking for. I for one am one of those customers ""that is stuck in the past"". My needs are very simple and I am deeply offended by the article. Maybe it really is time to look for a new solution.",None,I agree with Bill.  Just fix all of the stuff that doesn't work and/or the stuff we have asked for instead of all of the fluff and bubbles.,I'm starting to get worried about the direction SFDC is taking.  We don't use Lightning at all, but have 1000's of hours in custom development of classic features (APEX, VisualForce).  I see lots of development on new features, but not much in the classic environment. Please stop creating shiny new features for the next Dreamforce and focus on improving what we already have.  Pretty please? It feels like you are catering to your stockholders rather than your users.,None,I am wordless,Over a decade and still no way to use a switch statement.  This is a normal programming construct in any other programming language.,None,Have we seen any updates on this?,None,8 years????? smfh......  This is more important than Lightning to developers and Salesforce (from a multi-tennant prespective), should have been implemented a long time ago.,I've been wanting this since I started working with SF in 2009.  Had it in C, C++, Java, other languages, it's not like inventing a whole new parser - the pattern is there.  Please add, since if-elseif-elseif-elseif-elseif when all you're doing is matching to a single value is a big ugly bit of code.
Cut and paste image into rich text fields,Ken Erb,Product Team Review,9100,16,None,Really need this to be possible ASAP, Do we have a clear release scheduler for this?,Standard case object - THIS WOULD SAVE SO MUCH TIME FOR ADMINS & USERS! This is basic functionality which I would expect to see in Salesforce.,Standard objects is the most pressing need, thanks,We require this functionality using the standard case object and formulating a HTML reply back to the client. This process is causing our agents to suffer from inefficient processes.,@JenniferSacks @Salesforce: Based on the continued upvoting of this idea, one would think you guys would be more forthcoming in your updates. In the last one (9 months ago) you stated that the challenge was due to the editor being used by different teams. My apologies but I think for most users this really isn't a concern since we are used to and frankly expect to have similar functionality to what MS Office products provide. Please prioritize this as it's already been 7 years and still now ability.,Need ability to quickly and easy copy and paste screenshots,This is a MUST HAVE for our users...we're trying to drive adoption for our Service-oriented users and this is one of the most basic functions that they need,We def need this! The current process is too time consuming.,We require this functionality using the standard case object and formulating a HTML reply back to the client. This process is causing our agents to suffer from inefficient processes.,As a service console user we require the ability to copy images directly into our reply HTML emails. as these are specific to each case it is not plausible for the team to upload the image into the server and then try to get it attahced to an email,None,Wish this could be addressed by Salesforce. It is a feature staff ask for all the time.,None,Standard - this will help our support team. So need it on cases and knowledge articles, please!,I can't emphasize enough what a huge time saver this would be for my end-users if implemented.  We have a custom object with multiple rich text fields created specifically to display screenshots.  It's ridiculous the number of steps the users have to go through to get a screenshot into the rich text field.

More Summary Groupings please,This is critical for proper reporting in our solution. This is not a nice to have, it's a show stopper in terms of beeing able to create the needed reports for our users.,i concur with all the comments above... needs far greater than 3 fields; useless otherwise. spent approx 3 hours with a developer to be told that the report i was after could not be created due to this limitation and now am back where I started... running a report from salesforce and manipulating data via excel.,Atleast 4 lvls is required on summary reports ,Much needed for one of our requirement.

New Apex Feature: Anonymous Classes,Richard Vanhook,Under Point Threshold,970,11,None,I agree !,Would be easier to use callouts with JSON.serialize().,None,Please do it! Otherwise we'll ask for lambdas! =),It`s is very important!!!!!,This would be useful for structuring the code running in asynchronous context: Future, Batch, Scheduled,It will be very helpul in calling functions dynamically.,Anonymous classes would also help to write more readable test cases., Anonymous classes will also help with event handling.,Vigirously agree; this would be a big step in the right direction (though there are other steps that need to be taken, too). Presently, Apex is so static that I often find it very awkward to implement non-trivial functionality. I'm actually HAPPY when I get to bypass Apex and implement certain UI functionality in Javascript.

Such a basic function - quite an oversight to exclude for Lightning.,Disappointed this is missing :-(,Really? We have embraced lightning and now find basic functionality missing....,Must have!,Seems like an oversite. Need.,Needed in LEX desperately!,This seems very basic,Silly how standard functionality isnt on SF Lightning...,Dupe: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000E3YBQA0,None,Agreed, my support team uses this button when closing every case in Classic.  Definately needs to be added into lightning.
Allow Buckets on Formula fields and Summarized Fields in Reports,James Loghry,Under Point Threshold,1150,14,Please! This will be super helpful! thanks!,Would allow me to do so much more with my reports!,We have needed this function and it would really benefit our reporting and dashboards!! ,There are multiple ways we would like to use this function.  Putting summary counts into ranges is the primary.  Please add this function!,Bucketing summarized fields is important for donation reports. Would really appreciate this feature. Thanks, Meta.,Sometimes," categorizing contacts into a ""Bucket"" requires more complex filtering than can be accomplished using a single field.",That would be awesome!!,+1,This would be great!,This would be a major improvement and is something that we receive requests for a lot.,None,We get this request a lot with our nonprofit clients.  Would be a huge help.,This would make a big difference for nonprofits.  I need to be able to pull a list of donors at giving levels, and it's currently requiring a work around.,Bucket on formula field would be extra powerful.
Allow In-Line Editing of Dependent Picklists in List Views,Jenna Weiner,Product Team Review,3660,15,None,Need this feature asap.,Thi would be SO useful!!,These feature is very useful.,It should be implemented.,None,Salesforce... this should be at the top of the list for new features. Rediculous that you still can't edit dependent fields from list view. REDICULOUS!,+1 for this: it would make the user experience with lists much clearer,This is a must needed feature to change assigning methods. ,This is a great idea and nice to have,In-line/list view editing saves an insurmountable amount of time in the management of multiple entries.  Not allowing this feature causes unnecessary burdens.  Please consider this simple change to allow for effective management within the Salesforce tool.,I used to be able to do in-line editing on hundreds of data fields and it saved me so much time. Please make that possible again. ,We really need this feature too!!,Weird limitation, should be standard. Would make customer data management much easier for users.,Why Salesforce why?
New Cloud Flow Designer Element - Attach File,Rick Methe,Product Team Review,3390,15,This is a must for our distribution company. We generate over 4000 shipping labels a day and need a way  to store the label after its created.,None,None,This would be great!,I was surprised​ that this is not possible.... It would be very helpful  - also for other functionalities  (e.g. actions) to request an attachment within the creation of an object. ,Yes .Need this asap,This would be useful because use cases have definitely come up.,We really need this!,Please, we need more votes for this one. This should be added!,This is a very imp and required functionality as this can automate lots of process of sales team,Especially because Global Actions do not support this functionality either.,This would be such a useful as on! There are numerous business processes that require or that can greatly benefit from either attaching a document or a photo and to have the ability to do this directly in a flow would be nvaluable,We could really use this!,Very useful ! Please include,Including this feature can optimize self-service requests from end users to support personnel, making things simpler for both parties.
Lightning Report Chart Click-Through,Michael White,Under Point Threshold,570,5,I intuitively expected I could drill on the bar chart - surprised to see I cannot.,Sorry, I meant this link to the known issue: https://success.salesforce.com/issues_view?id=a1p3A000000jmXyQAI,There is a known issue regarding this: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000CMJYQA4,Yes, I was surprised to find that click through doesn't work.  It acts like it should work (pointer finger when hovering, javascript:void(0); on status bar, but nothing.,I hope what we now have is just MVP and that they'll be adding click through to report soon. It makes no sense to show the chart and not allow clicking through to the report.
Nesting Folders / Sub-folders for Reports, Dashboards, Email Templates, etc.,Alex Sutherland,Partial Delivery in Summer '15,66890,16,None,None,+1,Please, can we have this feature or at least consider the feature to help Clone whole Report folder and its content. ,I think the partial delivery is worse than no delivery at all.  At least before I could search ALL reports to find the one I'm looking for.  Now I have to search folders and then search within each folder.  If I don't know what folder my report is located in then I could be forced to do a search in every single folder.  Why can't the search function just search both folders AND reports?,None,None,Would be tremendously helpful. Especially for email templates, as I can already see that ballooning out of control for us. Why does this not already exist?,None,Is there an update on whether this is possible? Seems very easy to implement,Spring release is on it's way is there an upate? @JenniferSacks,None,@JeffiferSacks (hoping that worked) - Is there an update to the sub-folder upgrade?,How about an explanation of the challenges with this enhancement?,None,I reviewed your Spring '17 highlights deck, but did not see anything about sub-folders in Libraries. Has this been delayed, or did I not read the deck carefully enough?
Report Option for Distinct/Unique Records,Margot Quandt,Under Consideration,10160,16,None,As mentioned Power of 1 has limitations, so would be extremely useful functionality.,Example: I have an activity object that contains email addresses that performed the activity.  I want a report that counts the number of unique email addresses used during the month, without grouping by email address or showing the email addresses in the report.,Yes, Power of One doesn't always work. Please deliver this feature!,We have scenarios where the Power of One doesn't work. ,This would be nice to have.,It would be really nice to group by the number of groupings in a report. If I have 300 possible values, group by that field, get a results of 255 unique values. Its a pain that this can be done in SOQL, but not in reports. ,POO was not a useful solution for an opportunity with products report as result aggregated all products onto each unique opportuinty ID record.  Deleting the custom field I created for POO didn't reverse unintended consequence of formula either.  Need a workaround.  Been doing this in Tableau and xls as SF has too many limitations.,Been on Salesforce for 3 months now, this would be really helpful. ,This is a must have for our business.,Since I can do this in SOQL, I assumed a Report would be able to do this.  I'm disappointed I need to Apex my way into this query and cannot give my users the ability to do it on their own.,Please add this. The Power Of One is a limited solution. It does not work on other scenarios. ,None,This is a must have feature . Business sometime require this kind of data.,The need for distinct rows in reporting is essential to business.  The Power of One does not solve this problem.   Please add it to your roadmap.,None
Generating Storage Usage Report,Joshua Jackson,Under Point Threshold,2150,16,None,None,ditto!,None,Storage Usage under Data Management shows storage by object, but it would be nice if I could see this as a report, then create an analytical snapshot to see trend over time, and use this to predict future storage needs.,Our data storage is changing often and this would help us to monitor easily without Admin privileges needed.,I would use it as a way to monitor our storage usage.,Would use the report to keep track over time (i.e.: by generating the report at various intervals) of the change in storage usage and use this to make predictions as to when we need o buy more or make descisions about optimising current storage procedures, etc. Impossible to do if we arent capturing and parsing that data (and then summarising in table format over time). ,will be used to make purchase decisions on additional storage needs, all contained from one report or dashboard view. ,we will use it get trend of data storage used on daily basis,Agreed - need this trend data to budget for additional Salesforce resources and know what areas need monitoring for data storage needs over time.,This would really help the manage the data and predict the data storage requirements.,None,None,I would use this report to build a trend report.,This would be useful as it is a requirement under a SOC2 control to monitor and review bi-annually, capacity and license usage in SFDC for metadata/data that is in scope.
Automatic Geocodes For Person Accounts,Bahubali Vijayakeerthi,Under Point Threshold,170,0
Reset Developer Account to vanilla state,Emily Cheung,Product Team Review,6290,15,I can't believe this hasn't been put in yet. Certainly, make a user confirm 5 different times before a wipe but it's absolutely necessary that a developer is able to start from a fresh slate now and then.  Making us create new accounts is wasteful of our time and SF's resources since they potentially end up with a bunch of dead accounts just sitting around when someone moves on to the next.,I felt the need to have this feature, it will help me experimenting more in free developer editon,Must have feature!,"I'm not sure I'd go as far as calling this a ""must have"" feature"," but it would surely be ""nice to have"".",this would be very useful,None,This wold be very helpful.,Need The destructive power for creating new things and new test. ,Yes please! This is a useful idea. I am tempted to create a new one but managing all those email accounts I'll be having irks me.,Hear Hear!  I believe we all recognize the power of destruction that funcationality has, so please limit it to development orgs only, and buyer beware!,Must have feature,It will be very useful functionality, please provide it.,None,Give this functionality already!,Yes please.
Allow deletion of List View Charts in Lightning,Michelle Nunnerley,Under Point Threshold,1950,15,I can't believe that this hasn't been on salesforce road map for 10 months..,Yes,it's so small but a must have service.,None,This would be great,Yikes.,Yes please !,Such a small thing to delete unwanted charts but sooo annoying :( ,This is a no-brainer. And please add a possibility to share these charts, too!,Totaly agree,Totally agree with this idea. A User should be able to delete the default Chart, as well as any chart he makes on their List Views!,Please add the list view charts delete! The users create a lot of charts,Admins at the very least need to protect users from themselves.,Being able to delete to stay clutter free is good.,Keep us clutter free, we need this option.,This is a must have!!
"Allow custom ""Text Area (Long)"" fields on Activities.",Erik Jegel,Not Planned,11280,16,None,None,Please fix this!!,A must for us - I need a task outcome field where sales guys can record the outcome of the meeting or call etc and often they want to paste in notes made on an ipad.,@kristie garafola - any luck on resolving this?,None,None,Needed!!!,None,How about you just take the standard long text that is in there now and make it so it's not standard on calendar syncs.,Would also love to see Rich text area in the Event object so that meeting notes can retain formatting.,OMG! This causes problems with event syncing because whatever is in the description field can be seen by customers and that is the only place to paste meeting notes. 255 characters will not cut it so it's really important to have at least another ling text field on the Event object. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!!,How hard is this to implement really? Could we at least up the character limit from 255 to even 500 or 1000?,None,Come on Salesforce this is basic functionality - 8 years and 9 merged idea's, its obviously needed!,This is pretty ridiculous as this is where people take notes about clients and SF.com only allows 255 characters.  This makes this area of Salesforce.com pretty useless
Default Record Type in Permission Sets,Mary Lorch,Under Point Threshold,1690,15,Record types should be locked down if an organization needs them to be.,I too have wished for this feature for a very long time. Permission set default record type should override profile record type when assigned. Is a great solution for making a temporary change to a particular user without having to clone a whole profile.,This will be great to have. ,Much needed,We need this as well.  For the issue where a user could be assigned multiple perm sets that have a default record type assigned, Salesforce can just sort them A-Z by label and choose the first in the list as the default.  This would be acceptable behavior for us, and it can be worked around with the solution Robert Parris proposed (having a separate perm set that just assigns a default record type).,Came up today with one user who does not need the same default record type others with his profile need. Having the ability to set the default via permission set would allow me to turn this off and assign everyone except him.,As said - removes necessity creating a profile or some other workaround, just for the default ability.,None,None,Such a simple thing, but would be so useful.  Don't see why this isn't already part of functionality as its such a simple concept and would GREATLY help in decreasing the number of profiles in an org.  ,I would vote.,None,I haven't read through the comments yet, so someone has probably already pointed this out but.. this isn't possible. What happens if I have two perm sets assigned to me, and each one has a different default record type setting?,This is really required, there are times we want to control default record type to other users using permisson set who are using same profile. I don't want to create new Profile just becasue of default record type.,Would be very convenient when trying to reduce the number of profiles in an org.
Turn off Auto Populate of Address,Justin Simmons,Under Point Threshold,650,10,It is necessary to be able to turn off autopopulate the account address fields on the related contact.The sales team needs to manually remove the prefilled address fields and then repopulate with the correct ones. It is nice to have to switch to activate/deactivate this functionality.,Apparantly remove FLS visibility to the  field on account, removes it from being pre-populated on the contact record when a new contact is being created.,None,+1,None,I've heard there's a way to do this, but can't find it.  If it's been resolved, I'd love to know.,This has been a huge problem for us, as we have contacts linked to accounts where they will NEVER be at the same address and we have to take extra care because it always overwrites with the incorrect address so we are losing real data if we don't pay attention.  This is urgent!,Agreed, I'm not sure why something so simple should be so difficult to accomplish.,Turning off auto population is mind numbingly, frustratingly difficult.  Creating a custom button that sets the address fields (and phone and fax) to blank doesn't even work.  Any solution I can think of involves creating lots of custom fields or re-creating existing functionality.  It's just stupid that something so simple should be so hard to do.,Workaround: The address is taken from the Account Billing Address field set. If you use the Account Shipping Address field set instead, you won't have this problem.
Disable access to classic UI,Christian Deckert,Under Point Threshold,2320,16,Safe Harbor, yes, Summer '17.,Definitely needed!,Absolutely needed! It's the only way to really get full adoption from my users. ,Must have requirement. We do not want our lightning users to switch back to classic.,Safe Harbor, yes, Summer '17.,None,Makes sense,very suprised no one thought to make this a general system permission in the first place to be honest.,Definitely helpful!,"@Mauro: Just open the profile in setup and watch the url behind ""...salesforce.com/""",Felix how can I find the Classic Profile ID? I didn't get it, could you help please? Nice workaround!,None,None,Any workaround would be appreciated. ,Workaround for now?,None,Very much needed. Upvote!
Rich Text capabilities in the Case Description,Yaniv Levi-Tzedek,Product Team Review,3110,15,None,Desperately needed.,None,None,This feature is very much needed. Any info when it will be delivered?,None,None,None,Absolutely viatal to allow Rich Text and inserting images when replying to support calls,Hello SalesForce Team, this is critical for everybody please act and provide this capability html would be much better. Thanks :),it's time to deliver it. ,Cases communication are extremely difficult to parse for relevant information.  Please give to a UI/UX/AI designer to solve.  This is embarrassing.  ,None,looks like a herculean task sf, doens't it?,Not only in the description. Even a greater need is the richtext in the case comment. add screenshots, links to documents and other stuff in comments is a must function.
Lightning Experience - Recycle Bin,Johan Yu,Product Team Review,4150,15,This is needed as we are in Lightning Era now,+1,Needed, please add.,Recycle Bin missing, as is Clone or Save As on list view. Both need to be migrated to LEX,This is needed in Lightning as well!,Need this in Lightning,Please add the recycle bin into Lightning.  ,None,Need this basic function on Lightining. Crazy that it is not there.,A must. ,obvious correction needed,Please," adding this basic functionality to Lightning is critical. From a support standpoint its really difficult to instruct customers that they must go back to Classic in order to access this funtion. Common reply to that line of support of: ""What is the point of Lightning then ? "" Makes us look bad. ",Recycling bin is duely missed in Lightning. Pls. add.,None,Required for lightening. It must have as we introudcing only lightening to our users.
Resubscribe Button Should Override Pardot AND Salesforce Opt Out Field,Alison McConoughey,Under Point Threshold,510,3,Hi Mark!  After posting here I had the same thought you did.  The bad news is, (at least for now) the Automation Rules only evaluate once," so if your mailable prospect (who meets the ""not opt out"" automation rule) clicks ""unsubscribe"" and then resubscribes...the field won't go back to ""not opt out"" because they had previously met the automation criteria.  The good news is this type of scenario is probably pretty uncommon AND there's an Idea to allow Automation Rules to evaluate multiple times:  https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000cN6mQAE",None,Does anyone have a workaround for this?  I was hoping to create a completion action that would assign a Salesforce task each time someone resubscribes but I'm not finding a way to do so.
Filter sync from Salesforce to Pardot by Contact Type,Lee Ann Wilcox,Under Point Threshold,330,2,"Default syncing between SalesForce and Pardot creates a lot bogus data in both systems and we just have learned that a user has no control over the filter functionality or turning off an ""Automatically create a new prospect in Pardot"". One would expect to have a capability either to select fields or criteria if and what to send from CRm to Marketing Automation. We have many workflow rules to keep our data in SF clean", and any time the change occurs," data is transfered to Pardot without having us to decide if Yes or Not. We were told to use Sharing Rules asssigning ""Non-Pardot User"" but it sounds like a bad joke.",Agreed. We have our whole ERP on Salesforce. We're letting them sync then deleting but this ought to be possible via a simple filter.
Reporting on Scheduled Reports,Kevin Richardson,Product Team Review,7690,15,Would be huge for us admins to d housekeeping!!,This is especially important since there is a limit on scheduled reports per user.  I depend heavily on exception reporting to notify me and other users of problematic data, and it's a pain to have to keep track outside of Salesforce of which users are subscribed to which reports.  I do hope that this is being actively considered for development!!  ,ASAP!,This will be so helpful! ,Yes please - this would be so helpful.,None,Seems like this would be a benefit to SFDC as well since it will allow us to find obsolete reports that are still being run and consuming resources.,We really need this,This would be so helpful to have! Trying to find reports to unschedule isn't easy right now. ,Could really use this!,This would be extremely helpful.,Definitely will be very helpful and sorely needed.,It would be really helpfull to update scheduled reports and dashboards ,Could use this right now.,Many of our customers would love this functionality and benefit from it greatly
Ability to prevent deletion of Activity History,John-Adrian Pipe,Product Team Review,6100,15,we need this, this is activitiy history,Definitely a must have to control action, either via a permission set or rights via profile.,Will probably be fixed in lightning and not classic but I'll vote for it anyway.,We need this feature. Soon. ,This is absolutely needed!,Would love for ability to prevent tasks from being deleted pls.,Absolutely crazy that this idea has been open for 8 years. Why doesn't Tasks just have the same Object Permissions as the other objects? I love Salesforce but it drives you mad when you come up against weird little inconsistencies in functionality like this.,Please allow us to prevent users from deleting tasks.,Cannot believe this one is still out there and unresolved....,To see that this has been on the Idea page for 8 years and nothing has changed is astounding.I would love it if someone from Salesforce would at least respond so we know they saw it and what the plan is, if any.,Yes yes yes! I just had someone delete a bunch of Activity records the other days. YIIKES!,Just to keep this thread alive... COME ON SALESFORCE,How is it even possible this isn't something that hasn't been corrected in over 7 years? Does SF actually pay attention to the ideas? This functionaility is crucial to our compliance process. We need it NOW not another 7 years from now!,Sure hoping this is a fix that arrives sooner than later..........any ideas for workarounds other than removing the related lists from page layouts?,Need it now.
Remove the targeted community from Chatter Posts,Stéphane Houle,Under Point Threshold,20,2,None,"Just found out that the ""Only"" string is actually linked to the org name"," as to say that the post as been shared to our internal community (so our org) ""only""",but with a capital. This just makes everything even more confusing for our users.
Log an email set for Send Later in SalesforceIQ Inbox,Jeff Burke,Under Point Threshold,100,1,I agree this would be very useful.
Lightning Experience Redirect From Login Page,Andrea Borsani,Under Point Threshold,190,0
"Allow Created Date in ""Notes & Attachments"" related list",KFret,Product Team Review,3270,15,It is ridiculous that the last modified date of attachments changes when a case is transferred to someone else. The last modified date of an attachment should only change when something is changed to the attachment itself. But as Salesforce apparently does not recognize this as a bug," but keeps calling this ""standard behaviour""",at least give us the solution for this idea.If Salesforce would allow the Created Date to be added to the Notes & Attachment list this would already make a lot of people happy.,I just don't understand why this cannot be changed.  SalesForce PLEASE fix!!!,None,I can't believe this is still an issue. SFDC, please fix.,Wow 9 years and still waiting. ,Seems an obvious one!,This seems extremely basic, why has this not been implemented?,This is needed in LEX as well.  The new Note editor is great, but I want to see when I created the Note whether I'm in the Note editor or looking at the related Notes on an object.  Last Modified Date is not enough.,This seems like a simple and logical request.  Please add the Created Date to the Notes & Attachments related Lists or Fix the Last Modified date issue.  We are utilizing Apttus now and attaching agreement iterations.  Not having a reliable date is making the users a bit crazy.  It should easy for the user to quickly identify which is the latest modification.  It is next to impossible when all the modification dates change when you attach the latest one. Users need to either click to view each document to find the one they want or click the Go to list to look at the Create Dates. The very least that can be done to help is to add the Created Date to the Related List.  ,This has caused a lot of issues while working a long running case that had many attachments.  The customer could not see which file was the latest attached and we had to give unique file names so the customer could find the correct one.,AND SIZE!,Very basic, need this.,None,"To have ""created date"" is an must", we can't live with last modified date and each time documents are added the date of older attachments is revised automatically.  ,None
Add more than one chart to a report,Karen Higgins,Under Point Threshold,1450,15,None,This would be terrific.  Huge time-saver.,Would be nice to be able to use the same report to display two charts, one with values = sum of quanity and the other with values = sum of sales. ,Seems silly to have to duplicate reports to get different charts (either on the reports or within dashboards), if you could use either report chart to feed a dashboard component that would save the administrative burden from having multiple replicated reports!,Would be very useful.  I dislike the idea of having to clone a report in order to chart different data from essentially the same report. ,None,None,How does this not have more votes?  I guess people use dashboards more often?,None,None,Multiple charts in a report would be great,...how is this not a thing.,I am using Report Charts on my Account page layout and would find the ability to create multiple charts useful since I cannot include a dashboard.,None,why not?
Inline Editing for Related Lists,Chris Thompson,Product Team Review,10910,15,Would be a big productivity gain when entering information.,9 Years and counting. ,.,definitely need this capabililty.,This would be such a big benefit for our Users,This capability will greatly increase productivity.  These are the kinds of features that should be native to SalesForce to ehance the user experience.,None,None,Can we get an update on this Idea?  With over 10,000 points, it seems that this is a no-brainer.,Hi, I am hoping someone can assist me. I have a custom object related to Cases. I have added it to the Case page and would love to be able to click Edit All so we can edit all the items at once and not edit 1 at a time. of course we cant do this natively. any help would be great. Please note I am not a coder. thank you.,This is a much-needed function,  ,None,None,Yes, please. Contacts on Accounts & many custom objects would benefit for all my clients.,Hicham - this looks fantastic! Still a little unclear on how to set this up though. Are you able to help?
Select Files/Attachments from Related Record when composing Send Email,Jeffrey Kranz,Under Point Threshold,1100,3,This is a really great idea!,Highly Recommendated!,Innovative Recommendation!
Set field level security for multiple fields at once,John Kokkelmans,Under Point Threshold,2270,15,Must have.,This not being avaliable is beyond me.,"I'm now* performing what I call a ""Click-A-Thon"" due to this not being available. Inefficient for sure.","I'm not performing what I call a ""Click-A-Thon"" due to this not being available. Inefficient for sure.",a feature that is truely needed,Sorely needed...it goes without saying.  Sadly we need 39 more votes for it even to be reviewed,This is SO needed!  I makes moving items via change set so much more onerous!  PLEASE SALESFORCE FIX THIS and make it so we can assign record types to multiple profiles at once after the record type gets moved via change set!,Is this insane or just imbecile to assign FLS for each field in the same object separately and manually? SMH.,We needed this feature since forever. Can't believe it still has not been delivered. Please deliver this and it would save a lot of time during creating/updating profiles and also during deployments.,We needed this feature since forever. Can't believe it still has not delivered. Please deliver this and it would save a lot of time during creating/updating profiles and also during deployments.,Insane that you cannot do this in bulk,You can only do this when creating a field, not anymore afterwards. That's not logical.,What a burden to do this individually for each field!,@Nathan Franklin - Sign me up as a beta tester!!!,None
"Unbucketed values - ability to change the name from ""Other"" to something else",Charles Naughton,Under Point Threshold,2400,15,+1 for this, definitely would be useful from a visualization perspective rather than explaining to the team that Other = Unassigned or Unknown.,None,None,Adding this function would be great especially when reports are used in dashboards!,None,+1 for this functionality OR the ability to add null values to a bucket.  If I could do one or the other," this problem would be solved.  I just don't want my data getting dumped into an ""Other"" category.",Really need this! Executive focus on the 'Other' value and doubt our ability to understand our data.,Its crazy that this isn't aready there....  especially when you have a task subtype as a blank for meeting and shows up as other on the report.,+1,Please add this. Have to export to Excel to rename that field, not good ;),Yes please make it available!,Yes Please!,None,"This would be a great feature to add context around what ""Other"" encapsulates. ",Please add this feature!
Automatically Clone Reports when you Clone a Dashboard,Jeff Matthews,Product Team Review,3150,15,Absolutely needed!,need this,A must have,6 years and counting and no changes have been made to enable this feature?,This will be an awesome feature to have. While cloning it should ask if you want to clone only dashboard or reports also?,please... ,Would be very helpful and save time.,Would make life easier when we create same kind of dashboards for our 20 teams!,None,Why is this not a standard feature? ,Yes, please! I have to Clone five Dashboards, each containing at least 9 or 10 Reports and will have to do a Save as on each Report so it does't modify the original Dashboard. Ugh!,a major need for my customer.  huge time saver and helps improve adoption.,Great idea.,This would save a huge amount of time and effort.,Great option
Include Topics in Lightning,Mia Whitfield,Coming in the Next Release,2240,15,It will be available for record that supports lightning, but have to start # for topic,Will these be available for all objects in lightning? We would like to be able to use it with calendar events and tasks as well as clients/accounts. ,None,yes please make it available to Lightning. This is a blocker.,This is a significant part of our Salesforce implementation at many clients in terms of structured and unstructured collaboration and search. Please introduce to Lightning ASAP!,Seriously. Why is this not avalible in Lightning, and why has it taken a year to fix? This feature should have been available out of the box on day one. ,In Classic you are encouraged to migrate tags into topics.  Now we find that topics are not supported in Lightning, the UI that we are supposed to embrace and adopt. Please support this idea!,Must-have for bringing structure and more targeted comms.,Must to have :),Agree with all previous comments that without topics, it's difficult to organize Chatter. May as well go back to searching Outlook to find those conversations...,None,#LightningTopics :) ,Definitely a need!,Much needed.,I'm so surprised that this is not available in lightning.  This is crucial to staying organized.  
Increase limits for summary formula fields in reports,Melinda Gonzalez,Product Team Review,3640,16,None,None,None,It would be nice to have an update on this. I have multiple reports where it would be useful to have more than 5 formulas. The limited reporting functionality in Salesforce often drives us into exporting our data into Excel, which is counter-intuitive.,Please, this would help us out so much, and a lot of others by the looks of it. These fields are very helpful for fixing various things in reports, such as naming and for charts alongside using them for proper formulas, so get used up really quick! Also would be nice to be able to put the columns anywhere in the report rather than just at the end. Sometimes I will use one just to get the columns in order!,Waiting for this update,,Looking for an update on this, when is this expected to be released?,Any Update?,Please!!!,This is important to our reporting. Looking forward to an update.,None,None,I agree, the limit needs to be raised.,This met the threshold a year ago, still no update to share?,It would be great to have this,Waiting for this one to get released
Email logs should contain the subject of the email being sent,Kelley Minor,Under Point Threshold,290,7,This would be of great help l when email services fail and critical external emails are not sent. We use email relay and have had issues previously due to missing IP whitelistings, and while we can identify failed emails, there doesn't appear to be any way to discover what email alert failed to assist in re-triggering failed emails.,Without having some way to link the Email Log to a template it is very difficult to troubleshoot when you are having an issue that is impacting a larg % of the emails sent by Salesforce.com.,None,The subject or at least the id to the email template would be extremely helpful,A must have. When multiple emails are sent to the same user , its impossible to debug and find out which all emails failed.,Absolutely a great idea - would be really helpful when tracing emails sent via workflows.,great idea !
Sales Price field on Quote Line Item object not required,Bien Elian Gallardo,Under Point Threshold,1280,15,Definitely, need it!,Absolutely needed.,Couldn't agree more. This is turning into a bit of a hassle, for something I should be able to control in the first place. Sometimes I'm not sure why Salesforce makes assumptions about everything being the same for everyone.,Need this! More GRANULARITY/FLEXIBILITY/CONTROL, POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!,We want it to just be one.,Need this as we use FTE's for Quantity  - I have to get the team to add manually which doesn't make sense when have the same functionality in Product Line Items.,being able to quote a rate without a quantity is important.,Yes, as the Quote is effectively a version of the Opp., it should have the same default characteristics.,Yes, I'm agree with Kim LIttle comment.,I agree. It doesn't make any sense that this feature exists for Opportunity Line Items but not Quote Line Items.,Please fix this issue.,Please allow the ability to make the quantlity and  sales price of Opp Product, Quote be optional, Thanks,Really need this feature. It should be enabled for both opportunity and quote object.,Sales Price and Quantity.  It is ridiculous that you cannot do this for quotes but you can for opportunities.  Yet another half-baked feature; one of a thousand in Salesforce.,Having this as an option is a life saver. 
Data loader and notification e-mailss,Brittany Poore,Under Point Threshold,550,15,Come on Salesforce, please allow for this basic functionality,"We are currently using ""Demand Tools"" from CRM Fusion which supports sending e-mail notifications on task loads.",I have been running into this for tasks and leads more and more often.  It would be very helpful to trigger email notifications to the owners using this tool so they are aware of the new assignment and not have to create work arounds to notify reps every time.,I have been running into this for tasks and leads more and more often.  It would be very helpful to trigger email notifications to the owners using this tool so they are aware of the new assignment and not have to create work arounds to notify reps every time.,I Agree.,Why an email isn't sent doesn't make sense.  When we insert tasks for our sales team we want them notified.,Salesforce must have a field where they track that information on manual creation of a task so they should just expose it to us. Although I understand that it may not be that efficient or counted as spam if every single task in a batch is processed on its own  and thus a single email is sent and not as a batch.,Absolutely need this option.  We load batches of tasks to help prompt Sales and Marketing users whereby we add tasks with the due date and want the reminder emails to go out in the future with the reminder date.  Not having this option via dataloader is a setback to being able to fully leverage the benefit of the Reminder functionality.,None,It seems strange that you could create a mass task, but not be able to prompt people to complete that task.,It seems strange that you could create a mass task, but not be able to prompt people to complete that task.,I have a similar case.  Without a notification e-mail, Assigned To persons may not be aware of the Tasks.,I have seen where others say they are doing this via DBamp or force pages, but seems like it should be an option on dataloader to simplify the process.,None,This would be very helpful especially when I am trying to add over 500 tasks and I have multiple reps that need to be aware of the new task assignment.
Customize the Mass Transfer Accounts Layout,Pierre Eymard,Under Point Threshold,1750,15,l really need this as well!,Very helpful!,None,Yes! It will be very helpful.,Yes, very useful indeed.,Very useful feature!,This would be really helpful,we need that functionality to be customized.,Why not?,We definitely need to be able to customize this layout. Salesforce Development Team, please make it works. Thank you.,Still Yes,agreed, we need to be able to customize this layout (and add the country field),Would be a useful productivity enhancing change.,Does anybody at SF ever read or take notice of their customer requirements?? no reply nor comment from SF on this matter..ever!!, what a waste of time!! :-((,Let's make this happen already...
Change Sales Path To 'Path' And Extend To All Objects,Joseph Fiega,Partial Delivery in Spring '17,2200,16,None,This would be perfect for Contacts!,I'd love to see this on Accounts.  The use case is for clients that have a short and transactional sales process that does not require an opportunity.  The status can be tracked on an Account record, the visual would really help users.,Absolutely needed and critical for Cases.  HR servicecenter has new employees all the time and using Path for training/coaching reinforcement is a must.,Would love to see this feature on Contacts and Accounts/Organizations.,We need this on Case object. ,Accounts object please.,"Case object please!  Our cases go through a staging cycle and would love the ""path"" functionality.  Easy to use", bring the important fields front and center that are required for that particular stage, etc,None,None,Orders and Cases would be extremely helpful!,Would love to see this on the Contact object!,None,Yes, please provide path for cases !!!,Upvoted and requesting this functionality to be available to CASE object as well !,Upvoted and requesting this functionality to be available to CASE object!!
Increase Formula Compiled Size above 5000,Margaret Sheridan,Not Planned,2590,16,None,It is really needed!! please do something about it!!,Really needed!!!,This is an absolutely ridiculous limiation & I cannot see any reason for this, the fact that it has been an issue for admins for so many years is shocking!!,I really suggest to increase the maximum compiled character limit for formulas. The limit available (5,000 characters) is not enough to cover my organization. Please increase the character limit for formulas.,This is still a challenge when trying not to use code. When can this be increased as it has been an issue for many years. Admins have been struggling with this for a long time. Please help !!,@Daniel, how do you parse it?,None,None,Even trying to resume formula it isn't an easy task!  I really need more than 5,000 characters.,Really need this!,The character limit is a real problem for us. We have formulas that are summing up the results of formulas and keep running into the limit.,Ok, If you can't increase the cap can you at least help us find the offending formula field. To simply be told that 'some formula field somewhere uses the formula field you are trying to save (perhaps not directly) and that field is preventing you from saving this field' is a bit unhelpful. You have obviously found an offending field because it triggered the fault. How about you tell us what field it is. That would help greatly in knowing where to focus our efforts in trimming formulas.,Having this issue because fo the Date Function as it relates to text.,None,None
Log mass emails sent from Inbox under activity history in Salesforce,Shashank Singh,Under Point Threshold,100,3,This feature is mission critical for my outbound reps,This would be useful in tracking efforts,Need this feature. Doing this manually is a time consuming activity
More detailed engagement studio statistics,Michele Lougheed,Under Point Threshold,80,4,Please," move the rocket Icon at the bottom of the reports page doesn't prevent access to the next ""button"" when drilling down into the statistics on the prospects list pages.",None,None,None
Inline Editing in Views - remove Filter Logic restriction,Eva DeLorio,Under Point Threshold,1130,15,It would help when we have complex business divisions who need filtering on records and fast access to update.,I was very excited to get this functionality in place...and then learned it's not available.,This is a very useful functionality. Is there any update on when this will be rolled out?,None,None,Seems like if you just delete the filter logic instead of hitting the clear logic link that it will indead keep the AND logic and allow inline editing still. Would still be great to be able to use logic and inline edit though,None,There is a work-around.  If I have something complex where I want inline editing, I make a campaign.  This allows me to use however complicated logic I need to populate and maintain the campaign. In the listview, I can then specify the campaign I want to feed the listview and keep the filter logic below 5 entries. Obviously, maintaining campaigns is more complicated and less dynamic, but with the latest improvements to Process Builder in Spring 2016, it's at least doable.  That said, I've upvoted the suggestion.,This is a much needed functionality.  I have ONE field that I want to filter on, but it is a picklist with many values.  The only way for me to make this work is to have multiple criteria and us 'OR' in the filter logic.  Totally lose the inline editing capability by doing this.  Frustrating to say the least.,Strange that there is a Record Type restriction. This should be lifted as most people view a record is a record is a record, so to speak.,Absolutely - very much needed here,This is needed!!!  Better yet, have inline editing for multiple record types too.,We ought to be able to have inline editing on list view along with filter logic,None,Can't believe this even needs to be voted on +10
Add Lookup Field Lightning Component,Sayer Martin,Under Point Threshold,830,15,This is a must feature indeed.,Absolutely critical for a consistent UX. Should have shipped right away!,Bump!,Waste of hours developing custom components. please provide this feature. much needed! thanks!,I can't believe this was not delivered with the first Lightning version.,This is badly needed,Need it badly. Can't afford to mess up with the lengthy alternatives.,Lookup field is very important. We have lot of visualforce pages where we need to include lookup fields. Please provide this component in lightning. We don't want to do lot of custom code just to get this salesforce in-built component. Thanks in advance.,This component is extremely important and used extensively in every other organization. I am so surprised and disappointed that it is not included in lightning framework. Why  we need to write hundreds of line of code to create our own look up field. Please please have this component included in your next release. Thank you. Happy coding in lightning.,This componetn is very useful, Please provide this component.Otherwise, we haveto write lot of customization.,This is badly needed. Upvote.,Bummer! The workaround provided is not easy to maintain and not scalable, I am working on an use-case that has 6 lookup fields on a form. We need this feature,It is essentially required, we have lot of use case to have lookup fields on the page. it is very difficult with the solution/Design provided by SF.Please get it as input component tag,This is essential.,None
Force a scheduled report to run immediately,Joe Murawski,Under Point Threshold,380,10,This is an outrage!!,Yes, this is needed.  Just setting up a number of reports and having to wait a day before add additional recipeints is counter-productive.,Yes very much needed for the Sandbox,Fully agree also - this is a long overdue item in SalesForce!,I completely agree!  As we are creating reports and wanting to send emails on a regular basis," it'd be nice to have a function to test the email similar to how email templates have a ""Send Test & Verify"" function.",Yes, this is needed for testing. Especially when your sending the report to users with different levels of access. I need to quickly get this report built and set up for distribution. Lack of this feature introduces hours and days of lag time into the process of using this tool. Extreamly inefficient. ,This would definitley benefit our company and allow for more live report, especially at the end of teh month when sales managers want the most up to date figures as deals close. Great idea, lets hope it gathers some momentum.,I definitely need this. Just had problems with a report scheduled for about 15 users, half of whom received it, and the other half didn't. No idea why, but this feature would help me debug the problem a lot faster...,Yes, would be very helpful.,None
Legends - To display or not display,John Bivona,Under Point Threshold,2470,15,Why is this not built in,I agree! Very useful!,This would be a great addition!,Absolutely agree!  Please add.,Yes please.,None,Simple charts to summarize Cases and # of Accounts become unuseable when the legend (each Account) is displayed. Need to be able to hide this legend and still summarize for totals! Please consider!,This would be extremly useful. Esp on dashboards where the charts pretty much cover the actual story. ,clearly needs to be a basic feature. this plus inability to group/filter by converted currency amounts really detract from the product,This should be an out-of-the-box feature.,To be quite frank - I am dumbfounded that it isn't already an option.,Please add... this will make dashboards more smarter!,This idea makes sense.  Report views in Classic already display kind of clumsily.  One less element will serve to make views with many rows easier on the eyes.,None,Please consider this idea. When you're only showing one value, it's seems like a waste of space and eye traffic to have a legend
Report Color Schemes,Daniel Tervo,Under Consideration,4840,16,The product team would like to tackle this, and the idea is currently being evaluated for inclusion on next year's roadmap (safe harbor). As plans become more concrete, we will update this space. ,The ability to customize colors for each chart is really needed to meet clients' needs. Yes please, add this feature.,This will be beneficial especially for a data driven company. ,None,None,None,None,This is a bad limitation! Frustrating...,This would be an immense time saver to our weekly/monthly/qtrly planning.,Agreed, this would be very very useful.,We would love this feature. Maybe you could specify your company colors in settings. ,It would be really helpful to have floating row option available on the report tab..It's really difficult to read a report when we have to go all the time on top to see the meening of the row,None,These colors make the reports difficult to read, impossible when printed and not very professional looking. ,This is needed as the purple is not the most attractive color for a report.,It does make it hard to read. I typically have to edit it in excel, which is time consuming. 
Deleted Opportunity Products to show up in the recycle bin,Elina Pogrebinsky,Under Point Threshold,320,3,This also seems to happen with Share and Team objects as well,None,You want to report on deleted records?  That goes against everything we work for as Administrators.If you want to report on records,don't delete them, but change a flag.  If you want to delete them, then delete them.But the recycle bin is there incase you make a mistake,not so you can create a data dumpfor separate reporting access.
"Filter Custom View by ""records I follow""",Amber Boaz,Product Team Review,3830,15,Support,SalesForce, do you have this somewhere in your roadmap?,That would be Great,Would be highly appreciated - and please make it available for Classic as well as for Lightning right away!,Where do we stand on this please? I can't believe something so simple has not been implemented yet...,"A field or a way to create a field to filter on ""records I follow"" is very much needed. ",An easy way to see the records/objects that you are following would come in useful and handy.,Was trying to figure this out today and I can't believe this is not possible. If we just had a binary field based on whether or not the logged in user follows the record... that would be ideal. ,This would make my job EZ! Thanks for considering.,This should be available for all the different objects,We've had requests from our users for this type of functionality!! Great idea... really hope this gets implemented! ,would benefit from this!,Very good idea!!,This is a brillant idea and a great way to re-use the 'follow' feature. Our users have even been asking for it !,Yes PLEASE!

ChangeSet functionality improvements,John McGovern,Under Consideration,13040,16,We are currently considering making Standard Value Sets available in change sets, which supposevely will solve some of the issues listed in this idea. Thanks everyone for commenting and contributing to this idea!,None,Agreed, please also allow for the removal of multiple components from a Change Set at once and not force a reload. Thx,Nice, but we still need to be able to add standard fields to a changeset.,If a Standard Field can be modified in Sandbox, it should have the ability to be part of the ChangeSet,None,None,We could really use the ability to add Case Close Page Layouts to a change set!,If you can modify a standard field in Sandbox it should be available component for change set. ,It simply does not make sense that we are not able to deploy standard objects and fields through change sets, this is definitely a must have!,wow can't even deploy opportunity stages...,Need the ability to at least deploy a change picklist set on a standard field. ,I've recently started to use sandboxes and change sets.  I was very suprised I could not add the Opportunity standard stage field and sales processes to a change set.  It doubled my work.  Please add standard objects to change set enhancements as soon as possible.  It just makes sense!,Picklist changes get me every time! I love doing extra manual changes after deploying my change set(s). :(,This is really needed in order to make change sets much more than a workaround during deployments.,So many times you think something is obviously do-able, like adding a case close page layout to a change set, but then no!  Very fustrating.
Page Layout Comparison,Chris Whiffen,Under Point Threshold,710,5,This will be helpful for Admins.,As I am working on cleaning up an established org, this feature would be a big time saver in consolidating our page layouts ,It will be really helpful if we have this feature. Also, it will be even grate if we have this comparison between sandboxes also.,An idea that would be incredibly helpful. Brilliant!,None
Save personalized column width in list views,Rhonda Ross,Under Point Threshold,1580,15,This would lead to a huge gain in prodcutivity!,This would be of great benefit as we modify the column width with each use.  Many many times per day multiplied by each user - think of the productivity gain!,Good idea.,This should be set in the view settings when creating a custom view for other users.  It is a particular problem when images from text formulas are used.  For wide images, the default column view cuts them off and a user must adjust the column widths.  There should be a way to speciy the widths so they will display correctly from the beginning (a user would still be able to manually adjust them).,Update: Use Google Chrome as your browser and column width customization sticks.,Please add this!!!,How is this not added?  How can this only have 128 Votes?,Please.,Would be a real pain releaver if this could be added,This is an essential element that needs to be corrected in ServiceNet, especially now that the classic ServiceNet will no longer be available as of this next week.  Column widths should be adjustable and able to be saved for each user.,This feature is a must, as far as I am concerned.  ,I agree with this idea fully. Very frustrating having to adjust every time !,Yes please, I realized this after a week of being introduced to SF. SMH,Yes.  Very annoying especially when most major applications allow you to format and save column widths.  It would be a time saver.,Absolutely.  Users are frustrated by having to reset this everytime.
View Child accounts on parent account page,Andrew Johnson,Under Point Threshold,2100,16,None,None,This is feature is needed, Please provide it soon,Would definitely like to be able to see children accounts when on the parent account screen,"The ""View Hierarchy"" link is present in Classic", but as not made it to Lightening.  Please get this working in Lightening!  This is needed functionality that should not have been left out.  Parent-child relationship is not very useful when you can't go to parent and see children.  This would be greatly appreciated.,I cant quite believe this isnt an option already - my vote is 100% this needs to be implemented.,I agree with everyone else on this thread! If SFDC is going to allow hiearchy functionality within accounts (parent and child accounts) users should be able to view this information (both up and down) easily within each account. ,Please roll this feature, this is needed.,Yet another ancient request. Why bother with Parent-Child relationships if a user cannot easily view from either side.,How is this not implemented yet?  there are many Ideas asking for this exact same feature for years .-.,As Melissa suggested, this should be merged with this idea:  https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000BpSCAA0,Also, perhaps this idea should be merged with this one to get more traction: https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000BpSCAA0,This is a pretty old idea," and it's resolved to my satisfaction in SF Classic with the ""View Hierarchy"" link. However", I have yet to see any similar function in Lighning Experience. In LEX, you can easily navigate from the child account the the parent account but not in the other direction. Please consider adding this to future LEX releases, as it's an important feature in many industries such as financial services.,There are many Child Accounts that have there own Contracts, Assets and Contacts, but as checked that there is no standard way we can display The details of child account on Detail page of parent Account! We need this feature as this is really Impossible navigation each child account manually, everytime.,We have many accounts linked to parent accounts but no way to drill down to child accounts. This would help a lot with our regional awareness of prospects, partners, and competitiors in Lightning.,None
Allow Lookup To Custom or Standard Object on User Object,Zach Bacon,Product Team Review,7480,15,Yes please! We need to relate our users to the Department object!,Yes, we would also make use of this feature.,yes ! ,This functionality is very much needed!,Trying to get our (FF HCM) Worker ID on the User Record. This would be great.,I am not sure but it can cause mixed DML operation between user object and non-user (standard/custom) object. Am I right? If yes, then it is not possible to link it at all. ,Yes, please!  So frustrating to learn this isn't possible?  We had a complex User report planned for one of our SF Communities by using a lookup, but were sadly disappointed.  Struggling to know how we'll do it now.  ,This will make a whole lot of difference in the way we report.,YES YES YES! We need this!,I'm not really sure why this isn't an option already.,Agreed.  With so many points why is there no response from Salesforce?,Agreed. This is needed.,"This would alleviate a lot of headaches when working with Financial Institutions. We really need a lookup to a Custom ""Branch"" object that we utilize on a regular basis.",This would make things much easier - we need this!,So we planned to have our community users groupped by a particular characteristic and then details that those groups on a custome object. It seemed obvious that it could happen, but apparently not. Why? Is this a pending upgrade?
Remove Lightning Experience Migration Assistant from Sidebar PLEASE,Steve Early,Under Point Threshold,20,0
Allow order of Record Types to be controlled,Michael Lee,Under Point Threshold,760,14,This should be a fairly easy fix and is 8 years old.... ,Please add this feature,Required,Super useful!,This will be a very useful feature which the users will like a lot.,This would be useful.,End user gone love it. ,Would be very useful!,Is this option still not allowed?!,This would be really useful!,Sounds easy to implement and very useful,As stated by another user, this is particularly useful for custom objects.,None,would be very usefull!
Email To Salesforce - Auto-association using information in custom fields,Petar Buha,Under Point Threshold,70,2,We too started with an early version of NPSP and have Personal, Work, and Other emails, along with the Preferred email dropdown and would appreciate the functionality described by Danny Browne below. ,None
SAML 2.0 Single Logout Flow Support,Daniel Canton,Under Point Threshold,1000,15,This must have functionality.  Please address.,Would really like to see this feature - currently trying to implement Salesforce External Identity for a WordPress Member site and the log out process involves a lot of redirects and could be a little cleaner. Any feedback on how to do this according to best practices would be greatly appreciated. ,Please correct me if I'm wrong. SalesForce will not implement SAML single logout profile only when it's acting as the Service Provider. However, SalesForce as the Identity Provider, what would be the case for SLO? Can you please explain?,SAML SLO is a must have feature and it does not look like an option to customize the solution.,This is a mandaroty feature and surprised to see not yet available for couple of years. Defenitely need this. Please upvote to reach the threshold.,definitely need this ,Great idea!,Please!,Much needed functionality. This is a huge gap when integrating with third party applications. Salesforce supports Single Sign On so this functionality would complete the whole loop.,We really need this. It's a security issue!,We need this badly to logout the third party app SSOed from Salesforce. :(,None,None,It is definitely needed,I am surprised on the number of votes this idea has received. It should be a high priority Idea due the security risk associated with it.
Object History related list isn’t supported in Lightning Experience,Pritam Shekhawat,Coming in the Next Release,5070,16,Quick update on this idea: Support for Object History related lists in Lightning and Salesforce1 is still targeted and on track for the Summer '17 release (Safe Harbor).,@Sridhar, You can verify your instance here http://trust.salesforce.com/ for summer17 release date.,@Pritam is this feature already available on the Lighting? If not, when is the Summer17 release date? Thanks!,@Pratam, thanks!,None,Bring on the next release...! We need this feature.,Yes, looking forward to having Object History related lists in Lightning. ,None,History related lists are not showing in lightning if we get this same as clasic functionality it will be very help full,As I see, Lightning is not a complete Salesforce Update. I have found a lot of important functionality that is only present in classic. I wonder if Salesforce dev team really validate all that we post here,None,Quick update on this idea: Support for Object History related lists in Lightning and Salesforce1 is still targeted and on track for the Summer '17 release (Safe Harbor).,hope this comes out sooner than later as I have been desperately trying to add this related list to my page layout under lighting and just could not come up (for Leads, Contacts, Opportunities, Invoices, etc. everything we need this),Critical!!,This is critical as the business needs to see related lists regarding Opportunity Stage History and Opportunity Field History.,None
Ability to Customize Account Hierarchy View in Classic UI,Jay Ange,Under Point Threshold,110,2,Will this be delivered in Classic?,Using the service cloud means that features we need aren't in lightning (yet, once it's more than half baked I expect to be able to switch). So an idea that is important enough that it took10 years, 2619 upvotes, and 11 merged ideas is important to get implemented isn't important enough for Classic UI users?
work.com in lightning experience,Alex Jacobi,Under Point Threshold,630,12,None,This delay my company to move to Lightning. Please add it to your road map.,None,We are piloting this but as we move to lightening we are going to have to postpone rolling this out until it is ready.  ,Yikes!  This will delay my company's migration to Lightning :(  I finally got my team to use chatter and work out loud!  This is one of the key features.  Super :( face.  Agreed.  Get it on the road map now!,None,We need this. Right now. I want to badge my peers.,Yes, we are constantly giving badges and thanks for all sorts of things.  We need this in Lightning now that our company has moved there.  ,Work.com needs to be on the roadmap.  We've been on Lightning since the beginning and paid for work.com under the impression it would be lightning ready in no time.  It still isn't on the roadmap?  ,This is a must," agree that all ""paid"" products should be within lighting. ",Yes Please.,"This is a key ""paid"" product. How is it not on the roadmap to work in Lightning? "

More specific History Tracking for Multi-Select Picklists,PlantCML User,Product Team Review,2510,16,Thanks for your idea!  How would you expect to see the old and new values? By comma separated lists of values, with each value being represented in a separate row? If you exceeded a certain number, would you be okay with seeing a truncated set of values?,None,This seems like a no brainer? It would be very nice for reporting. I do see how some could be very large but I would be fine with a truncated output? Being able to talk to employees who are making incorrect changes would really help our cleanup process.,This would be a very useful feature if implemented,Donovans Kruger's suggestion would work for us.,Does anyone have a workaround for this? I wasn't expecting to run into this limitation given history tracking is available for multi-select picklists, knowing someone has changed the value of a field isn't anywhere near as useful unless we know what the old and new values were.,A must have functionality.,This is so basic, it is baffling why the functionality isn't already there. If Salesforce focused more of their resources to improve the CRM vs. squandering them on peripheral functionality (e.g., Chatter) maybe this would already be there.  ,None,Old/new values view should be either comma separated or colon separated lists, listed on a single line.  Truncated values should not be used and wouldn't allow for consistency when analyzing the historical data sets (one Opp may have full values listed out, other may have values truncated - back to excel we go for more data massaging fun).,I agree that history tracking on multi-select picklists is useless without the old and new values being recorded. We just realized today that we had been tracking a field for years and the first time we needed to analyze the history there is nothing to look at. I feel like if the old and new values are not going to be tracked that the field should not be available for history tracking at all. At least then we would have realized day 1 that it wasn't going to work. For my org I think even a 255 character limit before truncation would be absolutely fine as our worst case multi-select picklist values are still quite small.,When will this functionality be available?,We should have a comma separated list for old and new values for the picklist.,None,I must concur.  I think seeing the comma separated lists of old values and new values would be sufficient for my purposes.  Taht would be a good idea, but I do think we need to see the list itself and not in truncated form.,None

Lightning - Increase Contrast between Text and Background,Aiden Martin,Product Team Review,3480,15,I commented earlier as I disliked the contrast. Now that we have rolled out lightning to a large portion of our users, I have gooten a bit used to it. The biggest complaint I am hearing is not the contrast," but how much they need to scroll now because it is less compact. At least the ""save"" button follows them now. I still would love to see a better contrast though.",All of my users, who I pushed to switch to Lightning, are complaining about the lack of contrast. I also find it difficult to look at SF. Let's get a move on this please,I agree--adding more contrast between the labels and the background would certainly help our users. Thanks.,During BAT testing many user over 40 complained of having difficulty with the gray on cyan and asked that we do something about the contrast.,This issue just came up during some development testing with a number of our sales SMEs today.  It would definitely be helpful to be able to adjust the contrast/color pallette.,+1 to all of these.  I can grudgingly live with it for the most part, but it's unacceptable in reports/dashboards.  There is not enough contrast to figure out different fields, columns, etc.  I will continue to switch to Classic to demonstrate reports. Salesforce has outsmarted itself here.,I get that the intention was to replicate the current Salesforce branding language within the product but what may work on the website does not work at all in the UI.  I find it baffling that this was ever approved for release in this state.  Such an easy thing to fix but no change (that I've noticed) in Summer '17....,This is my #1 Lightning dealbreaker.  I'm a Salesforce admin with low vision.  I also generally use a low resolution to compensate.  The lack of color contrast along with the heavy use of whitespace means that I have trouble distinguishing field label from the field value, and there is very little actual content on my screen.  There needs to be a user-configurable option to enable a high contrast color mode before I can consider switching to LEX.,I find myself switching to Classic because of the Lightning lack of contrast.,I find the lack of color in Lightning makes it harder for users to see the differences when being projected.,Nice Idea,Would be appreciated! Had a lot of complains about readability of Lightning.,Done,Had my first projector experience and had to flip back to classic to read anything. ,None

Mail Merge into MS Excel Document,Vincent Oliver,Under Point Threshold,1070,15,would be a very healpfull feature to be able to merge into excell,This is key feature that is required !!,This is a must have as we really need this feature to merge fields in excel for pricing approvals.

That looks a bit like how they do merge fields in excel.,None,The addition of this functionality would be very useful and help to expand the usability of the already very well designed system.  I am hopeful that it could be implemented in the near future.,Long overdue feature -- this kind of thing should be included in a service that costs as much as SFDC Professional Edition.,None,None,"Is this comming any soon?... Seems like one of those ""must haves""!!!... especially when we've been spoiled by Word mail merge... :P"
Merge Lead Records with Contact Records,Hunter Jones,Under Point Threshold,1990,15,No, when you merge 2 Contacts you are presented with a Screen prompting you to choose Field by Field which Record wins. When you 'Convert' your Lead into a Contact and choose to Update an Existing Contact, there is no Control over what does/doe not update, what we need is a consistent Merge between Lead / Contact as you have between 2 Contacts.,Boy this has been on the list for a long time.  Anyone know of any way to do this yet?,None,How is this not availble? It's so smooth for Accounts and contacts.  It would me nice to merge the same Lead name with exist contact to track our trade show leads with existing contacts.  What are you waiting for SF?,This is a must have since amrketing automation is growing faster and faster!,I agree - this would make life so much easier when there are multiple ways leads (and contacts) can come in to SF,This is a no brainer and should be out of the box for SF. 101 of CRM technology i say,Yes please is there anything!!?,This is a serious issue. Has Salesforce responded on how they are going to address the issue?,Yes, absolutely it would be an useful functionality,None,None,this is an good to have functionality,None,None
Inline editing of REPORTS,Mike Hamberg,Under Consideration,7870,16,All, this is something the product team wants to tackle, but it is not on the short term roadmap (i.e. next couple of releases). It is being considered for a future release, and we'll post more updates as that timeline becomes more concrete.  ,Much needed,None,None,We also use reports to clean up data as well as review tasks, opportunities, etc...  It would save so much time and effort to have inline editing available in reports and make it much more user friendly.,As a manager, this native functionality is an essential need for my daily use of Salesforce. Also my teams updafe efficiency would go up dramatically as well.,Excellent idea, the functionality of this would be very helpful!,I've been waiting for years,Inline editing on list views is a great addition to Salesforce and my clients love it. But inline editing on reports would be much more robust and could make editing of records so much easier and quicker. Please let us know when it is on the roadmap.,Please implement this...huge need!!,None,None,"I'm just shocked that this has been ""roadmapped"" for over a year. This seems like such a no-brainer (from a functionality standpoint); what's more it's something that would be applicable to almost every use case.",None,Any update on this very needed feature?,None
Support right-to-left languages in Lightning Experience,Derek Hans,Under Point Threshold,200,8,None,A must have feature for Hebrew & Arabic users!,None,Most of our costumers must have Arabic or Hebrew. Thay will be glad to use Lightning but it is neccesary.,Support right-to-left languages in Lightning Experience is very important for organizations that need their display well to read, Salesforce knows how much is comfortable UI puts the user in the center!,This is a must for our customers,this is a major show stopper for our chance to migrate the customer to lightning experience!!!,This is a real nessesity in our industry.
Unscheduling Reports Capability for non-Administrators,Helen Matheos-Vardy,Product Team Review,7060,16,None,None,Badly needed. Just to restate: Our salespeople can create and schedule reports. Make sense so far. But for the same salepeople to *unschedule* those same reports, we should give them Modify All Data permission? Can we agree that this does not make sense? Note for users/admins --> ugly but sometimes-effective workaround --> once you create a good report," have reps make a duplicate of it using ""Save As"" of that report", and have them schedule the emails/runs off of the duplicate report. That way when you/they want to discontinue the email reports," they can delete that duplicate report (which also deletes all the subsequent email runs of it). They don't need ""Modify All Data"" permission to delete their reports. Silly that we need to resort to this", and far from optimal, but may work for you.,Definitely agree!,Says its under review and there should be an update in 2-4 months, but based on the comments no one is really looking at this.  Agree that this is just super silly.,How is this escaping prioritization? Is the list of other sillier design issues really so long this one hasn't bubbled up yet?,None,Should be delivered years ago!,Please add this - this very necessary for non-admin users.,Very necessary feature,We absolutly need this.,Very necessary feature,This should be standard functionality.,Anyone who schedules a report should definetely be able to unschedule their own report! We an create and modify our own reports and data integrity is maintained, so I don't think being able to unschedule your own report will effect data integrity in anyway (it's a report schedule, not changes to the data itself). ,I have several reports that I modify," reschedule and delete schedules on a monthly basis.  As the creator of the reports I should be able to unschedule them easier than having to modify the schedule start/end dates.  I am not an Administrator and will never be given ""Modify All Data"" permissions.",Want to ensure if this capability is provided for Reports, it is also provided for Dashboards.
Link / Merge Community Profiles,Anthony Foster,Product Team Review,6410,15,None,None,i have so many profiles that its kind of put me off from being too active in the sucess community  as I know all the history will be loist next time i more jobs - not very motivational!,An outstanding idea!,Hopefully this will get some traction as It is difficult when you change companies to get the status you had previously. count me in as a vote  to see this issue get resolved.,None,This would make life way easier for some of us and give accurate numbers on your community!,This would make life way easier for some of us and give accurate numbers on your community!,Need this.,I now exist twice in a local community group... which unfortunately inflates the overall membership count I imagine. ,Yes please,Would simplify the.community experience.,I've worked hard to build my profile in multiple Salesforce communities, I've always felt that Salesforce does a great job at rewarding the people that invest in their product. I think this feature is definitely in-line with Salesforce ideology- I would love to be able to retain my reputation!,Couldn't agree more. We need our community contribution to be independent. It should be like LinkedIn for Salesforce. ,I have a login for my usual community account, but my Trailhead badges and certifications seem to be on another profile. This is annoying, since my trailhead account has no community points, yet on my usual community profile I've been giving answers in the community and have some best answers. i'd like to keep it all together to maintain credibility
Be able to search by ID,guest,Under Point Threshold,1090,15,Can't believe this is under the threshold....seaching by ID would be really helpful,Yes, this is a must have. Especially when trying to verify data sharing across platforms when testing third party applications like Zapier. ,Seems odd to have a unique ID and not be able to use it manually in search.,this is a must have,must have,Its data in the system? It just makes sense that this would be indexed and searchable!,This would be useful for anyone working with large amounts of data.,This is such an obvious thing that's missing. In my case I'm suing GetFeedback to collect data to sync to SF records. I just want to check the data is going in correctly and since the survey doesn't collect name / email etc. I want to search for each record using the SF ID. Putting it in the URL is inconvenient.,This would be helpful for us ADMINs and/or make the account name readable. ,Agreed, altering the URL is combersome, should be part of the search function.,Yes, please.  :),None,Margot, in your case," I'd bet that on these ""changed URLs"" the domain (na1.salesforce.com or what have you) is different", but the rest of the query string (with the ID number) is the same.  If it weren't, How would SFDC function?  I'd be curious to see a screenshot of one of your user's browsers, with the location visible.  Regardless of what your VPN is doing, you should still see a 12- or 15-digit SFDC ID in the URL of anything you're browsing.,That makes a lot more sense Margot, thanks for clearing that up.,Our VPN system is such that the standard Salesforce URL is changed and hidden from the users who are browsing via the VPN.  These users cannot manipulate the URL, and we often get the request to search by ID.
More Report and Dashboard Chart Color Customization,Maritess Hoy,In Development,6000,16,All, this is still high priority feature for us, but it is still a couple of releases out. The product team is working on our charting engine to provide flexibility to change colors.,I'm really suprised this isn't a feature already, more so that it's been in development for over 8 months and people have wanted it for over 6 years. This is literally the first thing I wanted to do as soon as I created my first custom report, there's no contrast between blue and slightly lighter shade of blue. I get that blue is kind of your thing but there are 7 other non-blue colors and thousands of variants of each color to choose from. I'd settle for a couple dozen total, so really, not a big ask here.,None,None,Different shades of blue for horizontal/vertical bar charts in Salesforce Lightning is sad. Finally got the org comfortable with their Dashboard components in Classic.This functionality is a must. I'm suprised this wasn't in the an earlier Lightning release. ,This is a significant issue for our users!  The ability to specify a consistent color scheme would make it so much easier to understand dashboards at a glance.,Adding my 2 cents.  This is incredibly important to us.  Not having the ability to build a consistent visual report devalues the whole exercise.,None,This is great, my client just wants to make their bar chart bars green, not blue as per company design guidelines! :),This is yet another example of a simple feature missing from Salesforce. I have two reports, displayed on the same dashboard, with the exact same information only different time durations (month vs. quarter), and the colors are different. And apparently there's no way to change this to make them consistent? This needs to be changed asap! ,None,All, this is still high priority feature for us, but it is still a couple of releases out. The product team is working on our charting engine to provide flexibility to change colors.,None,Would love to customize bucket field values for consistency across a dashboard,None,None
Use 'Owners' Manager for workflow purposes,Nate Vernon,Under Consideration,4250,16,None,We really need this for training purposes. We have an exception report scheduled out send to all Regional Managers. Sometimes, the data in the report doesn't include their team and they don't need to see it. I'd like to create an email alter to notify managers only when they need to see issues. ,This would be essential for our company. When specific requests are rejected by case status (not approval process) we need to alert the submitter's manager.,This would be a very helpful addition. Eliminating time and resources spent on a feature that could be in existence!,Any update on this. It would really help reduce the number of workflow rules we are using.,This feature is required instead of creating new fields and workflow rules for the same.  Thank you.,None,None,None,None,Really need this feature!,Would really like this feature!,We found a similar situation. We were trying to use Process Builder to create a task based on the Contact Object. We could not assign the task to the Contact Owners Account or Opportunity Teams. We ended up using a Flow to address the problem, but it seems like Process Builder should have that option.,None,None,None
Add read receipt details in the email view itself,Brenda Oh,Under Point Threshold,550,8,The read receipts folder isn't searchable or sortable so it is hard to find the read receipt you are looking for. It would be ideal to know the email has been read right from the email itself. You wouldn't need to see all the detail while on the email- just a heads up that it was read at least once. Then you could link to the detail in the read receipt folder.,Most competing services offer in-thread read receipt details and open times/dates as well as searchable, reportable tracking for opens.  Big miss with IQ, please get this going ASAP.  I just assumed it was here before cancelling our other service.,Great idea.,This would be a huge benefit!  ,None,None,It's a pretty big deal - today there isn't a way to go back and look at an e-mail and see who has opened it and when.  ,This would be huge! 
Contacts Without Accounts - Ability to make them not 'Private',Garry Polmateer,Under Point Threshold,1770,15,yes this is required,Necessary feature for those that do not want to transition to Person Accounts.  The lack of this capability really throws a monkey wrench into updating private account records without applying Modify All to the Contact record and introducing Delete into the mix.,This should be an easy change and allows us to have a B2C model without going to Person Accounts which comes with all its disadvantages.  Such as a doubling on storage for a person account and contact.,Yes, If you use account contact relationships and try to add a relationship to a private contact," instead of them being added and associated with the account as their primary tyou just get the error ""You can't associate a private contact with an account"" - Why can't I associate a private contact with an account??",Should have the ability to have contacts visible when not associated to an account.  Person accounts comes with its own limitations.,This would be extremely helpful to us since our end users are not direct customers and not maintained in the traditional account sense. ,If this could happen it would get rid of the need for the Lead database and save so much confusion and issues we have managing and (more importnatly) reporting on leads and contacts and marketing performance. It would make managing people so much easier and make salesforce a much better CRM 1 golden record of teh truth for a person no more duplicates between Leads and Contacts, one report for tracking marketing against people. Our marketing automation system could create a Contact without an Account and it have a Lead Status. Clicking a custom convert button would then run the user through a flow of Creating an Account and an Opportunity. The marketing automation system could continue to market to this person and the lead status could drop again. At a point in eth future this person may interact with marketing again and score up again as someone of interest. One Object in SFDC so reporting would be easy. ,Absolutely concur.  A contact may leave a company, and we don't want to lose his/her history.  But their new company may have no need to be an account of ours in SF, but no need to be private.  ,Any solutions to this yet?,None,Requiring a Contact for an Account or if not, making the Contact private is antiquated.  I understand why Salesforce does this, but it should be changed.  Since in my org, we need to have a many to many relationship between Contacts and Accounts, we will leverage the Contact Roles object.  However, in doing this," it means Contacts will need to be associated with an Account (even though they shouldn't be) to make this work.  This is the least worst option and I'd like the ability to make my Contacts Public without giving all users ""View All"" and ""Modify All"" privelages.",None,Not sure why this even exists. I spend a fair amount of time each week just adding account names for my users who cannot do it for themselves.,None,Great idea
Enable Product Schedule in Lighting Experience.,Deepika Mahindre,Under Point Threshold,900,15,Summe r'17 does not allow changing schedule using LEX. For a couple of customers, they will need to move from LEX to classic due to this.,Cannot turn the LEX on if this is missing. ,We really need this!,Need it badly.,As a consultant, this has come up with several clients as nearly a deal breaker on the adoption of lightning. Product Schedules is a key reason they use Salesforce and Opportunities. Disappointed their users have to switch to classic.,Need this ASAP please.,Just wanted to echo what was already said. It would be great for my organization to move over to LEX, but Product Schedule Editing is crucial to the day-to-day use here. Any way we could get a timeline on when this is going to roll out? ,We cannot fully roll out lightning to our users until edit scheduling is enabled.  We have been waiting for this from day 1 of lightning, and still not there.  What is frustrating is that SF is adding new features to lightning only, so we are forcing users to switch back and forth that need the new features.,We cannot fully roll out lightning to our users until edit scheduling is enabled.  We have been waiting for this from day 1 of lightning, and still not there.  What is frustrating is that SF is adding new features to lightning only, so we are forcing users to switch back and forth that need the new features.,This is a must.,None,much needed.  big gap for migration to lightning experience.,This is very limiting for customers who are excited to embrace Lightning, but need forecasting & product schedules.,This is a critical flaw in Lightning. Many businesses want to see recognized revenue and outside of having a custom object and a trigger (or someone just not using Lightning outright), this limitation is significant. ,Must have
Clone inbound change sets,Matt Ryan,Under Consideration,11500,16,Thanks everyone for voting up this idea.  We are not directly looking at solving this problem, but we are working on a project to improve the application lifecycle for our customers.  This will be significant change to the IT lifecycle, but will provide a lot of value, including solving this issue. ,Great idea, please implement.,None,So when is this new improvement of the application lifecycle expected to be delivered?,I suggest also improve outbound change set,that admins can insert into outbound whole inbound change set. If company has more admins transferring change sets to testing sandbox, it would be helpful to have option create outbound change set and inset into it some of inbound change set which will be transferred into production except of inserting every single field from all change sets. This is paintfull for release person if he has to release a lot of inbound change sets with hundreds of fields, layouts, objects, valudation rules, flows etc. ,Thanks so much for including this in the set of lifecycle improvements. This piece can't happen too soon! :-),Time Saver!,This would save a lot of time.,Agreed! Great idea.,I'd even take the ability for apex code to access the changeset object, so someone could write a tool to do this, if the Salesforce devs don't have the capacity.,Having to recreate an inbound changeset in order to outbound it to another org is time consuming and adds a pretty glaring point of failure.   ,None,Would be nice to have a sandbox flow configured and then enable one-click deployments of a changeset created in a lower level environment.,None,This is a BASIC/MUST HAVE for complete Lifecycle. Just imagine a deployment which has 500 components and moving to Production through 3 Pre-Production sandboxes. Its sooo tedious to add the components.,None

Is it likely to have it released During Summer 17 or at least before winter 18? our users have been eagerly waiting for this.,Going to try Doug's workaround for record type https://douglascayers.com/2015/11/18/salesforce-filter-related-lists-without-code.  But definitely need a means to use filter criteria on related lists. ,Possibility to add filter in standard list views is a highly desirable functionality.,I would like the ability to automatically sort the related list by date.,Great, will enable more useful UI.  Will use Doug's workaround in the meantime.,Yes please!,None,None,None,None,None,Can we please get another update for this critical enhancement? Thanks.,None
New/Edit Lightning Action Overrides should behave like native new/edit actions,Shannon Hale,Under Point Threshold,220,1,As of right now, the end result of the functionality as built in Lightning is that New & Edit Action Overrides are unusable. Because they display as a page," the ""+ New"" standard actions on lookups or tabs completely lose the context that the user was in before clicking the action. The workarounds for this are to use global / quick actions for the object", but those require removing Create/Edit permissions on the object.

Please let me know.,I need this for my custom object Project which is linked to Opportunities.,This will be an awesome feature to have. ,this is must functionality.,Has anyone created a workaround for this desperately needed functionality for project management?  I've thought about a team custom object or even just user lookup fields.,This feature would be awesome and is definitely needed. ,This is a necessity for our businesses as it will allow proper team collaboration on custom objects related to accounts and or opportunities.,Critical for our business to allow for collaboration while maintaining overall security.,Absolutely need this!,Would be an extremely useful feature!,Being able to add a Team type function would really help when it comes to managing projects.,Would be very userful feature,Great idea for collaboration purpose on custom objects,Need it for standard object work order. Please...
Switch between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic - stay on same record,Penny Hammond,Product Team Review,5720,15,+1 for many of the comments below: this is making it difficult for me to recommend switching to Lightning for my customers, as it makes the entire user experience more confusing. Without this, I'm more likely to recommend moving to lightning until there's more feature parity for things that are only used on occassion, which could be many more releases (because if my customer's first experience with Lightning is a bad one, that will make adoption an uphill battle).,Voted!,We really need this to happen sooner than later. Spend extra few minutes & clicks, when not needed,Super annoying,This is impacting my mental health. ,Yeah, this is just common sense.,Yes, very much needed functionality. As not all functionality is available in Lightning, switching between Classic and Lightning is neccessary.,Please make this happen. Until all features are available in Lightning there will be a dependency on the Classic interface. Toggling currently is painful.,Easy to realize and total common sense.! This is a no- brainer for Salesforce ,This would be very helpful, but the underlying issue and problem is the sheer number of times you find yourself needing to switch back to Classic. The ultimate solution is to make everything easily accessible and possible within Lightning, thus not needing to switch to Classic. I wonder if that day will come?,Not having this is going to hurt adoption.   There's not a single user I could migrate in any sort of reasonable time who won't have to switch back and forth.   If it's a hassle, they just won't go back to lightning,It's things like this why I'm delaying switching our Org over to Lightning!  I'd be much quicker to move from Classic if this was not an issue.  Great idea post!,None,That would help very much in the transitional period,SO needed!
Allow Case comments to be added from the Salesforce1 app,Shivanath Devinarayanan,Product Team Review,3480,15,Without the ability to add new comments on cases, I don't see much practical use for Salesforce1 app for service cloud users.,The app is useless for us without this feature. Would be a game changer to have. ,Critical functionality!,We need to use 'comments' in cases and other objects, because 'notes' are not reportable sufficiently. Not having comments available in the app is quite painful.,None,Agree with comments below.  Case Comments are a part of our daily work management.  We cannot utilize the Salesforce 1 app until this feature is available.  Definitely an urgent requirement.,None,Would love to see this on the product road map - it's very mkuch needed!,The lack of ability to read and edit Case comments is one of the things that keeps me from using Salesforce1 regularly.,None,Looking forward to have this feature. Much needed..,Case comments are our main path of communication in our support organization. The Salesforce1 app is not very helpful without this ability. ,We use case comments for all cases.  We need this on the mobile app!,Much needed for Agents..,Much needed Feature
Filter Dashboard Containing Joined Report,Gary Elbaum,Under Point Threshold,220,4,This would be an amazing feature and believe it would only be possible on those common fields that exist in the joined report, but still, that would be a great feature!,"See also ""Filter Joined Reports in Dashboards"" https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000kx3eAAA",Dashboard components with joined reports sources (like a live view minus a snapshot view based on 2 different objects) bring regression in the usage of filter (mess unavailable for joined report) so most of the time we remove these components avoid error message. We need it! pls vote,I'm with the same problem at the moment.

Sales Path Conditionally Required Fields,Curtis Clothier,Under Point Threshold,840,6,Agreed - what good is having a required field (which is a dependent picklist of Stage) if the Sales Path doesn't enforce the field to be populated when they advance stages using 'Mark Stage as Complete'?,Fully agreed, throwing errors via validation rules will have a bad impact on user experience.,Agreed. Im having data quality issues because the sales path does not enforce required fields. ,This is an oft recurring requirement from many customers and would make Lightning adoption so much easier.,This is a great idea that should be built into Salesforce without the need of 3rd party appexchange solutions.,None
Act as substitute of a User during vacation/out-of-office period,Rik van de Wiel,Under Point Threshold,380,4,Great idea, came to the forum to post this exact idea.

Process Builder - Reuse Actions,Brian Kwong,Product Team Review,3630,15,Re-using is a fundamental SDLC concept. We need that implemented for Process Builder.,Ditto what Danny Ross said!,Given how slow Process Builder is to load anything," having to recreate a ""Create a Record"" action with all the required fields multiple times is a painful exercise in patience.",Currently building a process with multiple crtieria and reptitive actions, that are either identical or differ by one or two parameters.  It is a slow and laborious task to rebuild the same crtieria and actions over and over again, it would save so much time if you coud reuse both," and then change one or two parameters as required.  I wonder just how long this idea has been ""under review"".....   ",Just discovered that you cannot reuse Process Builder actions, glad to see this idea is under review and hope to see it in a future release.,I would definitely prefer to call/use an existing action rather than create a duplicate version of it in the process builder.,This feature will really be helpful.,None,+1,This is a must! Please implement. I'm trying to recreate a workflow rule in Process Builder for opportunity closed/won so that I can create a case for different opportunity record types. However, the same task is created for each record type and assigned to accounting but i can't reuse it. It's not worth moving it all to Process Builder and just building the create case in process builder.,None,Major Pain in the A#@!!,Process Builder shouldn't even have been released without this capability. It's pretty much universal in any other process building tool.,This would be very beneficial. ,Being able to reuse actions would be great

Disable Trigger and Validation Rules while running dataloader operation,Tejas Gohel,Product Team Review,4530,15,Agreed. Would be a nice addition.,This would be a huge help!,"It would be very helpful to have a ""maintenance mode"" where you can turn off triggers", workflows, validation rules, etc., to faciliate large data updates.,None,Great to have this feature to disable triggers while running dataloader.,Please add this functionality!,This functionality is really useful and required in salesforce.,Would be nice to be able to disable validations for triggers (like for rollup actions)! So as an option in the validation setup screen. To be able to have validations only active for online editing.,None,None,Agree, this option will help a lot. ,None,Would be a nice feature.... for Data Loading in Production.,It would be great to have option to set trigger / validation option off while using data loader,running a batch to update existing data is very painful with dozens of validation rules to turn off, one by one.  We need a way to temporarily turn off all rules to be able to update this data. 
Exclude signature images being attached in salesforce email integration,Patrick Flint,Under Point Threshold,510,10,Needs to be fixed ASAP,This is very time consuming and frustrating.  Please look into this Salesforce,Is there any update on this issue, BESIDES the app?

Please combine to get the votes up.  Thanks,None,None,Sad that you have to pay for an app that in my mind, is a bug.,None,None,This issue is sooo frustrating!  You would think that someone could fix this...ugh!
More math functions in reports (e.g. median, standard deviation),Steven Maher,Under Consideration,5560,16,None,We have a lot of small donors who will give one or two large donations for a Bar/Bat Mitzvah or wedding. Which is wonderful, but a little embarrassing and wasteful of limited resources when we reach out to them assuming they can give those large donations every time. A median feature in formulas (or even better, as a roll-up option so we could stick it on everyone’s Account) would be a huge help for us and our donors of all amounts.,We need the median functionality please!,Is median so hard to program?,None,Any news on this one? Particularly Median would be really important to add...,+1 on this idea!,This would be extremely beneficial and should be a basic part for reporting. P95 is a metric used for calculation all the time.,None,this would be great,Why is this taking so long?  This would be extremly helpful. ,I definitely concur on needing Median. I know Wave can do many of these advanced math functions," but for many use cases that is overkill. Median deal size is a huge metric because it allows a truer indication of what the ""most common"" sized deal closed or being worked. Mean can be very skewed by large whale deals. Same thing with Age for opportunities or cases. I have one 1-year-old and the others are less than 2 weeks; the mean will be skewed", but median will pain a clearer picture.,This would be great,Incorporating all of the basic functions available in productivity and analytical tools should be a priority if Salesforce wants customers to leverage their reporting engine.,We need median. how come this was not yet developed ? ;-(,None
Export from View,Lia Budiman,Product Team Review,11930,15,Given the amount of attention this issue receives, given AppExchange partners have figured out, why is it that Salesforce has not?  It just makes sense to include this.  Why drive customers to incur additional costs with providers for this functionality Salesforce OUGHT TO BE providing out of the box?  ,None,None,None,Seems like an easy feature to add that would add value alot of value. While we acknowledge that we can create a custom report for this, that is not a quick option for all users.,This is something our users have been leveraging for awhile and since we now transitioned to lightning they are unable to export or use Printable View from list view.  It has been a core function for so long- please provide asap!,This would be incredibly useful.,I would like to this to also be available on the Console (service cloud),We do need to have the ability to export data to Excel from a list view in Salesforce.,9 Years, 11,570 Points, why is this idea still under review?,Sutha Parath you sir are a champion who can sleep easy knowing you have saved me, and most likely everyone on this thread, many hours of time each week!  Awesome work mate!,None,Bueller.... Bueller....,We are onboarding new users today. They were excited to learn how to use Views and then really unhappy that they cannot easily export their lists to Excel. We don't want to build reports that duplicate the views or install custom apps just to solve this. This is such a basic capability that I'm surprised at the amount of work arounds that are needed for what seems like a common sense requirement.,It will be very useful to be able to export data to Excel from a View. It would save time creating a custom report.
Custom calculations on reports - at the row level (not summary),Mickey Martin,Under Consideration,7090,16,None,8 years? Amazing.,Much needed functionality, ability to create ROW level formulas.,None,None,its been over 1 year since we had a response from product management on this much need feature / capability. Not having this feature is forcing us to do manual manipulation in excel. Please provide an update.,Any updated on this? ,We just came on to Salesforce.com and this is one of the first things we tried to do.  7 years is a long time to wait.,None,Hard to imagine this has been on the list for 7 years. I wonder how many custom fields have been created just to run reports or better yet, how many excel templates have been built for the same reason. ,Yes please!   Hard to believe this very basic function is not available in the Report Builder.  ,This would solve so many issues for commission reporting in my org as well as accurate sales leaderboards. We need to be able to incorporate splits/split % by line item for opportunities. It is very frustrating to be able to pull all these pieces into one report but not be able to do the final and most critical step (product subtotal * split %, summarized for each rep)!,This is really needed.  I want to calculate out a number at the row level and then sum it up.  This is to do a proper weighted average calculation.,None,None,Very Good Idea!
Report on Pricebook Entry,Charles Ma,Under Point Threshold,1310,15,We introduced a new app that tracks, manages and reports changes to Pricebook, Prices, Products.  It also works with Salesforce Quote to Cash (Steelbrick).  You can redline entries, create reports, worklows, approval processes, etc.  Go to the AppExcange listing for more info and a demo https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000DpZt6EAF,Really would be helpful to be able to include price book entry custom fields in reports!!,Why has this not been done yet?,It will be really useful.,This is definitely an extremely useful feature that will add value in analysis from business users and also from admins.Please act on it ASAP.,"I agree not being able to report on price book fields like ""type"" makes any reports for Pricebook useless. I am shocked that such valuable fields can not be reported on. It is definately hindering our functionality and costing us time as it will all need to be done manually. ",Seriously? This seems like such basic functionality that should have been in the Product long ago. ,None,Very Surprising to see this missing. A must have feature for Product Management if they want to see existing prices of their products,None,Indeed Very helpful when assisting Business teams with their Price Analysis queries.,Arg........just discovered this limitation. Why oh why cant I report on these!?,None,None,We still can't do this after 4 years? I would have expected this to be a pretty standard thing.
Remove a language from Knowledge,Stéphane Houle,Under Point Threshold,40,0
Customize the layout of the close multiple cases page,Eric Mauro,Product Team Review,3080,15,None,We need this as well. Please make this possible.,We need this new feature as well and I am happy it is under production team review! Looking forward to the solution. ,Need this funcationality so that we can add our Resolution Details field to the Mass Close page layout so our agents can close multiple cases with the same resolution detail.,Yes please implement this new feature,None,Please enable us to modify this layout.,We definitely need this!,None,A must have,This is something that should be a core feature. There are options for workarounds such as VF pages and complex workflow but SF should be making our work easier.,Please update this feature!,"We have a custom ""Resolution Notes"" field instead of ""Internal Comments"" and don't use ""Case Reason"" - we need the mass close functionality", but this layout is confusing and irrelevant for our users!,Must have feature,7-years later this is still a need, please consider it for product improvement.
Preventing Duplicates with Validation Rules,Janet Grant,Under Point Threshold,1210,15,This is absolutely required for the purpose that we are using Salesforce. We will not be able to utilize any workarounds so this needs to be fixed. Please update ASAP,None,All the workarounds just consume time that would be better spent elsewhere.,Hi but as i checked in trial instance(version) or developer or, the ISDUPE(Field) math function is not availble, May i know the reason please?,I was searching for a way to do this, and ready to go down the custom field / workflow route, but the now-native SFDC duplicate feature works really well to prevent dupes for custom object NAME fields. ,This is a very useful feature to have. The workaround of creating a unique id and populating it via workflow serves the purpose but has very poor user experience due to the cryptic error message that is shown which can't be customized.,This will avoid lot of apex code.,We really need this feature,None,Have this requirement today,  would be good to have an easy way to do it,All the workarounds just consume time that would be better spent elsewhere.,Please implement this feature,Much needed functionality!,its really helpful.....its worked means there is no need of trigger for duplicate checking,None
Merge Portal enabled person accounts,Nick Murza,Under Point Threshold,850,15,This is important for B2C community cloud use cases.,This is a much needed function as we often have the case where an account is created then the customer logs into the community and a dupe is created.  Perhaps we could re attach all objects to the community account but we would lose any details for the non community account.,We need to find a solution for this ,This is still an issue,Our organization really needs this ability to merge person accounts that are enabled for a user portal.  It is causing issues with our ability to implement other solutions because we cannot be sure of uniqueness on our consumer data with so many duplicates.  ,We have the same issue, has anyone found a workaround?,We definitely need this solution. This leads to poor data quality and very difficult metrics tracking on overall campaign success.,There should be some solution to merge portal user enabled person accounts as there can be 1000 of poratal user person accounts dupe.,This is a big issue for us as well. We'd like a portal record to be the winner and merge non-portal record data to the portal (master) record.,This is a huge issue for us as well.,This is a huge issue for us,We have the exact same scenario and as our portal users grow so does the problem of duplicate person customers that we cannot merge. We need a solution.,This is a huge issue for us as well,Yes, this functionality is required as we dont want to Disable customer account merge them and then re-enable them again, everytime we need to merge a person account.,If ever there is a time to merge person accounts, it is when you allow them to self-register...
Enhance Engagement Studio Reporting,Dia Firdaus,Under Point Threshold,140,0
Reports based on Public Groups,melbrien,Product Team Review,6920,15,Wow - hard to believe this is not already in the platform. It would be very useful.,Much needed. Would be great to be able to see what public groups, permission sets and live agent skills users have in one report or view.,We need this option as well.,Yes, please allow for public group filtering in reports. ,OMG This is a @awesomeadmn must!,10 Years!  Where is the feedback from the product team???,None,we need this for audit purposes!,None,A much needed one. Should have been setup a long time ago!,I've needed this many times. Please add this functionality!,We use public groups to assign users to custom objects where our client data is restricted. We need a easy report on Users assigned to Public Groups to comply with internal requirements.,Reporting on public group membership should be a standard report type.,++++ ,Should be delivered years ago!
Opportunity Kanban View - Summary Chart in Running User Currency,Gabriel Calbosa,Under Point Threshold,20,0
Clone action in process builder salesforc,Chris Manton,Under Point Threshold,2160,15,This should merge with https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000DnOLAA0 ,None,Yes, needed !,would be a great time saver,It is better if we can clone the entire process step including criteria and action,much needed!,This will save so much time. Process Builder crashing less often would be a bonus. ,In comparison, the visual flow that goes along with this process is only 2,400 and it has something like 80 nodes not including subflows.,None,PLEASE include this basic feature.  Process Builder is painfully slow already.  I dread having to use it ,As I am in the middle of building another process, it would also be nice where if the action is the same for each node, to have the option to build a process where the action only needs to be specified one time at the beginning, and you could just enter the criteria.,The thing that compounds the issue is Process Builder's speed.  Creating the a similar or same node or action 100x from scratch is painful on its own, but waiting for it to save is almost as bad,Please oh Please? About to embark on repeating the same step 90 times. Let me know if you solve this before i finish! ,Very silly you can't do this, it's such basic UI functionality.,Seems similar to https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000DnOLAA0
Ability to Paste Screenshot/Screen Capture Into Case Feed Email Editor Directly,Phaik Cheen Koay,Product Team Review,2570,15,None,Please add. This will save soo much time for our agents.,This would certainly save a lot of time and effort ,Would really improve client and employee experience with Salesforce,Agree with Elizabeth - this would be a critical to streamlining processes and improving the client experience!! Please get this added. ,At least half of the cases I own require a screenshot to accompany an explanation for the client. This funcitonality would not only save me time, so that I am not hoping from Salesforce and Outlook, but it would also proivde for an overall better customer experience. I can say with confidence that it will cut down response times and provide a more consistent workflow. ,please save our time,Would be super useful,Yes please!,None,None,pls fix thanks!,Surely a standard feature for an Enterprise CRM?,A Must in Service Center Environment! Please add the feature,None
Mass change all dashboards of a Running User to another User,Keith Sadler,Under Point Threshold,2480,15,Salesforce, please save my sanity! This would be hugely helpful, especially when administrators come and go in an org.,Definitely a much needed feature.,Our company is now a subsidiary of a much larger company.  We received a duplicate copy of their SFDC instance.  Now we are trying to eliminate unnecessary data.  1,732 reports tied to dashboards...THIS is an administrative nightmare!,Ugh, I need to update 55 dashes from my name to my replacement. It shouldn't be this hard!,Yikes! This is going to be an administrative hell.,I have to update 75 dashboards with a new Active user. It would be beneficial to be able to mass change the Running User either via Dataloader or a Mass Change.,This would be very helpful to our Org, and save us a lot of time. Please add this functionality.,MUST HAVE!,None,None,Having the same problem as all the others above. Has anyone come up with a fix?,It would be nice to have the ability to update the Dashboard running user through the data loader.,None,Please! I can't believe I have to go one by one...this is going to take forever.,This is a must have.
Allow the login Application type to be reported on and used in list view,Autumn Hearne,Under Point Threshold,1580,15,An essential, must required feature. My client organisation would like to report on the effectiveness of SF1 usage and this feature will make my reporting easier. ,I agree with this completely. Ideally I would like a 'True Last Login' field which only shows logins which require someone to actively request access, not just turn on their PC and the system 'login' for them through either SFO or Chatter Desktop.,It is one of these things that are so common sense it is hardly understandable why it is not available yet,Yes please! This will be helpful!!,I'm trying to get a report so that I can add to the monthly dashboard - a bit of competitive motivation to show users how many times others are logging in and using salesforce, and via which applications -  so a report that shows the different applications that users are logging in with is exactly what's needed! ,Very much need this in our Org!  Essential feature...not a ''nice to have!'',and platform and browser type etc....reporting on this login info is so valuable for adoption monitoring and promotion, but also technical teams in understanding that needs to be supported withing their user group etc.,None,None,Must have!,I truly don't understand why the Application field is not available for reporting.   Login reports are useless because we are unable to exclude syncing.  ,A must!,Need it.,Definately a must!,It's crazy that the Application field is not available for reporting purposes. We want to be able to filter out the Salesforce for Outlook logins in reports, as they totally skew the metrics.
Change Picklist's assigned Global Value Set,Kamil Murawski,Under Point Threshold,270,4,None,This definitely needs to be fixed! It makes me want to avoid global picklists at this point.,Shocked it wasn't there from the beginning.  What a pain.  ,Definitely needs a fix
Allow Public Groups in Report Filters,Anthony Foster,Under Point Threshold,1180,15,None,This feature would help us in Team reporting of different groups instead of hardcoding the team members ...,"Easier to change members of a group than it is to edit the Oppty Owner criteria of mulitple reports. I have two people who are co-mangers and they can see their subordinates opportunities+their own opportunties when they run ""My Team's Opportunities"" but not opportuntities owned by the other.",need an easy way to report on  our service agents that cross role, deparments and regions,This would be beneficial for our organization, to be able to run a report on public groups to see who is part of each public group.,we need this,I can't imagine this would be that difficult to implement and would be a HUGE help.,This would help us quite a bit, as we have thousands of users in hundred of public groups.,This would be extremely helpful to have this ability to filter by Public Group. Most of our users have the same role/profile. I would like to group them and then filter reports by this group. Much easier than having to filter by owner alias!,None,@ADPNAS, I agree that reporting on public group reports would be a helpful enhancement. @marilynl,sorry,"but I can 't see the status of ""Large Enterprise Idea"" for this post.",Thank you for submitting your Idea. As @foster pointed out," there is a duplicate Idea that already exists (http://ideas.salesforce.com/article/show/10088590/Allow_Public_Groups_in_Report_Filters) We will merge this Idea within the week to consolidate all the votes & comments.Please use the""Search then Post"" functionality on the site to avoid posting duplicate Ideas.To alert us of duplicate Ideas",please use the“ Report Abuse”function.Thank you!IdeaExchange Program Manager ,None,Similar idea - http://ideas.salesforce.com/article/show/10088590/Allow_Public_Groups_in_Report_Filters,It would be very helpful if we could include Public Groups as a column and filter criteria in the Report on Reports The idea is to show which Public Groups the report is shared to, or which Public Groups are no longer being used anywhere and can be deleted.
Allow changing the default community access in the chatter publisher,Chris Peterson,Under Point Threshold,930,10,We also need this feature,None,None,None,We also need this feature. Please give access to add I think it is easy to get solution.,My company would also need this.,My company is having the same issue, it seems like such an easy fix.,Should be easy to do - pls do it!,None,Our company needs this option
Ability to schedule when process builder triggers,Marie Chandra,Product Team Review,3950,15,Agreed. This would be very beneficial for regular clean up processes, like a nightly run that checks and updates a rolling date when it comes due.,I need this! Come on Salesforce - You Can Do It!!,Would save so much manual work,I need this!,There are so many ways this would be useful....!,IMO, this is not available because of SF is trying to limit the number of high-volume processes. Creating a scheduled, regular job is easy in Apex, however only a small percentage of SF orgs have the expertise to use it. Making it easy to schedule workflow processes would flood SF with poorly designed jobs. They could crank down the governer, but that would only annoy people more.,None,Agreed, This would reduce loads of manual work,None,If we can fix up a date/time to let the process trigger, It can work wonders and helps us automate a lot of manual things.,I love this idea! This is much needed.,The process builder absolutley needs this. We want to send emails based on statuses and time that has elapsed between them. Having an hourly schedule to check opportunities and fire when a certain amount of time has passed without the record being updated would be big for us.,Great Idea!,This would be very helpful. I've done a scheduling tool that loops through a custom object, setting flags and waits. Something standard would be great.,George Weilenman, Matt Metzinger, and Doug Yeager mentioned that this idea was implemented in the process builder (https://success.salesforce.com/answers?id=90630000000Cv8kAAC) or by using the process builder to run visual flow with wait event (https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=vpm_designer_example_wait_looping.htm&language=en_US).
Add formula field to Tabular Reports,Mary Lorch,Under Point Threshold,1760,15,None,I googled how to do this, and was really surprised to find it's not available. Seems like a basic reporting-system function. Please add it, thanks!,Definitely, need it. ,None,this would be awesome. ,So true, this enhancement is really valuable; formula fields are definitely needed on non-summary fields as well. Please vote!,Agreed - calculated fields would help with creating quickly refreshable dashboards.,Amazing this still isn't possible in Salesforce. Am I overlooking something?,This idea needs more votes, will be much helpful feature,Yeah, I really do see why we are still missing this three years on and it's under the vote threshold. I know it can be solved using a custom field on the object but why waste a custom object field when it could be done within a report. ,This would be fantastic...,We too need this at more than just the summaey level.,Glad to see there's already an item for this. Get out the vote!,As everyone requested please add formula in reports for line items and not only for summary fields. I refuse to create a new field for each calculation needed at item level.  ,We need this too.
Table report - sort by two columns,Mattias Nordin,Under Point Threshold,1100,8,None,None,This would be wonderful! Plus, we should be allowed to choose ANY column on the component to sort by.,There is a lot to say about reports, but this is really basic!!!,Yes! I'd like this functionality. Seems like something Salesforce should have.,None,None,Please, please, please!  Do this for list views as well.
Allow Prospects to Opt Back In,Robert Yocum,Under Point Threshold,750,3,It would be nice have kind of an automated email template for  MASS OPT IN in cases when the emails were blocked and ended as Hard bounces. In reality, email address is correct, has been validated by Emal Validation system,  a person never opted out , it just a restriction by IT department  if our emails sent via Pardot  goes through or not. Due to the sync with SF, we can't email our  customer becuase of false command by Pardot system.,If a prospect opted-out for some reason and in time subscribes to a newsletter again, an automated optin would be preferable..,Also helpful would be the ability for an admin to opt-in a larger group of people. For example, if a specific company blocked emails from the Pardot user resulting in Hard Bounce and opt-out, but then white-listed the sender. It would be nice to opt-in all users from that company rather than go through individually. 
Support for fully private (no read or write) activity sharing model.,patrick de vylder,Product Team Review,7760,16,None,None,None,None,None,We need to make few of the activity confidential. please make sure about this as we need it.,None,None,This issue is very important for many companies. To be fix quickly,None,Oh ....and I'd say role hierachy ,I vote for #2. When is this going to be done?,Our previous CRM had the ability to label tasks, meetings, calls," etc. ""private"" so that no one else could view them. This is critical to managing our workflow and doesn't seem like a Herculean task for you to build out this functionality.",If you have a hybrid sharing model in your org such as accounts public and contacts private with sharing rules for teams, then having the activities/tasks/events private to the owner would only solve one piece of the puzzle.   The privacy would also need to take into account if there is an existing sharing model for the contacts and apply those rules as well. ,None,This is a must to provide a clean dataset to the users.
Provide the Email Daily Digest option for Communities,Mia Whitfield,Under Point Threshold,1130,16,None,Any updates on this?,Are we any closer to the personal(user) digest for community users?  My company just rolled out partner community to our manufacturer's representatives and could really benefit from this feature.,Make sure this feature can be used on Community Templates as well!!! ,Any updates - This is much needed for our Org.,Any update on this?,None,Bobby, great news.  I really look forward to this feature.  I subscribe to 50+ Groups in both the Success and Partner Communities.  Those are two communities that probably would great pilot 'customers'.,None,Yes, very much agree that this is a must have or it will cause people to drop out of their Communities if they feel spammed by it. ,Receiving emails on every post will be too noisy for most users so they'll switch to never receiving them which is not ideal.,I agree - notifications on every post will discourage users from posting!!,Every post will hit our users too hard - current users are already going to loose Chatter History as we're having to recreate from Chatter Free in the main org to Communities users in the Community......please please please give us a daily digest!,Please give us the same options as the standard chatter email frequencies - if the emails are coming too often they are written off as 'spammy' and ignored. ,Users will opt not to receive notifications at all due to too much noise! Agreed a daily (or even weekly), option would be the best solution here! ,Yep totally agree - each post will drive people nuts especailly if it is a very active group! I'm surprised Salesforce didn't make the settings the same as Chatter in the standard Org.
"Give option to remove ""Always Displayed"" fields from page layout",Nadia Ayoub,Product Team Review,16690,15,"Close dates outside a current quarter seen to nullify the Account Summary for an account and within the Account Summary tab the funnel and Ammount Summary by Stage information.  This is incovenient.  I was told to clear the ""Close Date"" field but cannot.",8 years later.......... Do they even look at this page?,I would like to make this field not required.,None,None,This should have been done long ago. 8 years Salesforce!!,Want this asap,So frustrating, please remove.,Hi Salesforce, please consider this idea also for Mini Page Layout - 10 required fields. It does not make sense to always display some fields in special cases. ,+1, please.,I struggle explaining to clients consulting time spent working around SFDC hard coded functions.   I don't understand why SFDC purposely reduces flexibility.,None,Thank you for this tip but apparently for the two fields we have this can't be done. They are universal fields which can't even be modified for individual profiles.,I agree，PLEASE make this happen！,PLEASE make this happen!
The ability to block followers in Chatter,Steve Bunda,Product Team Review,2610,15,Agreed - this continues to come up as an issue within our org. We have folks that should not be followed, yet we have no way of controlling. Continued source of frustration.,Seems like a basic function that should be here.,This keeps coming up - Please fix - it has been requested for years.,Please address as it is very important for the business.,One of the basic must-have features, this should be enabled this asap.,None,This is very importane feature. Otherwise stop this exisitng feature,Absolute nonsense, and a major securlty threat. SalesForce please enable the feature to block followers. ,Customers are requesting this in LACA,We have an account that we use for system-related activities and its having followers creates lots of confusion in the organization. Far better to have an option to disallow followers.,Seriously! My actions as an admin - many confidential in nature (such as deactivating exiting personnel) are being broadcast through my chatter feed by users who have decided to follow me? Totally not acceptable. I MUST BE ABLE TO TURN THIS OFF. ,Our org needs this feature.,It's amazing that this was not considered when Chatter was in development. I now have a client who wants to turn Chatter off because a few influential users have complained.,Yes, please,Blocking followers is an essetial feature which is missing. 
Ability to Enable/Disable Activities on Standard Objects,Ted S.,Under Point Threshold,510,1,Great idea and seems simple enough - there are so many unused Objects in many SF instances, this will remove uneeded complexity for the users.
Process Builder - Run as Admin/System,Douglas Midgley,Under Point Threshold,1050,15,Can't believe this doesn't have more votes, I need this like yesterday...10 days ago yesterday.,This would dramatically improve the benefit that the process builder provides.,None,This is super necessary. Process Builder is a massive leap forward from Workflow but until it can execute actions without throwing errors all the time, it is severely hamstrung.,None,Yeh, this is a bug, not a user story.,Upvoting this, but does anyone know of workarounds in the meantime? I see what Brian Shor posted below, but that's not going to work for my needs; I want the process to run regardless of who is editing the record, but I don't want to open up permissions to all users. I have at least two scenarios where this would save me a TON of time and effort.,Seens like an easy and necessary fix,Flows need to run as admin. Very frustrating that a process-launched flow can only run as the user.,Definitely need this.  Not sure why Salesforce is even forcing us to vote on it.  Sounds like something they missed when they launched this.,None,Strange to see this so low in votes as it seems almost more of a bug than intended design. This is very problematic for implementing logic with fields that need to be hidden from view/inaccessible.,I agree totally!  If Salesforce truly intends for Processes & Flows to replace the bulk of workflows, this is essential.,Yes much needed functionality.,I would have thought the same, for me this issue only came up recently, and when trying to look for work arounds etc there was no answer, and couldnt find another idea so...here we are :D
Ability to group by AND display a field in a report,Kristin Flewelling,Under Point Threshold,1000,15,I use a custom date field for tracking subscriptions (which is necessarily different to opportunity close date), and want to group by the month in my subscriptions report, but also see the specific subscription date as a column. Frustrating this is not possible, so yes I upvote this!,We use a customized version of NPSP and I would love this functionality also. Would make life so much easier.,I have this need too," and the workaround of creating ""pseudo"" fields just for this particular reporting purpose unneccessarily clutters the quantity of fields in the object", but also confuses my end-users with extraneous fields inside Report Builder!  ,We would like the same functionality. It would be great to be able to group by a date and also be able to present the detail date field on each row.,Steve Molis and Joe DeSouza - your suggestions work only for the close date.  They don't help for all other dates fields - custom or otherwise.,I agree. We have so many custom date fields and it is such a pain to lose visibility of the date once you group by it.  Creates extra fields.,Not just for Opportunitues, but for reporting/grouping activities and events.  I get that it's a mortal sin to duplicate data, but we should be able to derrive the month/qtr/etc. from a single field without resorting to custom fields.  This feature is common for just about every report writer I'm familiar with...,None,None,I can't believe doesn't have more votes! We shouldn't have to create and maintain dozens of custom formula fields to get functionality like this. It should be standard at least for Opportunity reports to grouped by Close Date (by quarter, month, year, etc.) yet still show the specific close date as a column of the report. Not to mention all of the other great uses this would have in other reports!,6 years we've been asking for this.  How hard can it be peps?,I agree! We shouldn't have to create formula fields to make this happen.  It seems easy to be able to group and display the date.,Wow 5 years and no solution? Is there another thread that has addressed or fixed this issue? Another item to the list of things SQL has to make up for...,Yes. We need this functionality. We run into so many reports everyday that need to be grouped either by month OR Year, and would still want to have to see the date as a column too.,This functionality seems pretty basic and would be extremely helpful.
Enable Duplicate Management control through REST API,Stuart Hamilton,Under Point Threshold,40,2,It's too bad this idea has only 40 points as of 2017-06-09!  Duplicate management is a great feature to have and since REST API is becoming more powerful with every release, providing REST API developers the same functionality as SOAP API headers will only become a necessity in the near future.,Please allow all features of the SOAP API on the REST API. It doesn't make sense that one needs to change technology or create custom rest services just for the sake of one missing header.
"PROPER"" text function",John-Adrian Pipe,Under Point Threshold,2290,15,Woo another decade-old idea, still waiting to be even looked at by SF,Thank you Matthew Harris!  This is very helpful!,None,We desperately need this.  And it needs to work for multiple words-- not just one.  There's no quality workarounds for that scenario right now :(,"If there were only someone that did a John-Oliver-style ""Why is this still a thing?"" (and if there is", tell me who I need to message when I bump into this stuff),None,None,It is much needed ,None,None,None,None, This is often called Title Case. A TITLE() function would be useful, even if it did not manage to handle everything perfectly. ,The formula is actually...UPPER(LEFT(FirstName, 1)) & LOWER(Mid(FirstName, 2, Len(FirstName) - 1)),Thanks a million for the interim fixes.And yes,a real solution would have enough intelligence,or a method of gaining it to realise that MACDONALD becomes MacDonald and not Macdonald,and JEAN - PAUL becomes Jean - Paul and not Jean - paul,and VAN BASTEN becomes Van Basten and not Van basten.Here 's hoping!
Reminder Settings - time interval for tasks,Michael Thaler,Under Point Threshold,390,7,15 min intervals, or the ability to change to 15 min intervals is valuable ,15 minute intervals would be extremely helpful.  As it stands, the reminders are a huge asset.  However, based on the importance of getting back to potential customers when it is convenient for them is crucial in our line of work.  15 minute intervals would help to ensure we are fulfilling our customer's expectations.,the more control over this the better,Should be 15 minutes,15 minute intervals is fine by me.,I definitely agree this reminder settings should have five minute intervals instead of 30 minutes!,Do you currently use the SF Outlook synchronization capabilities?  If not, download SF outlook Edition 3, this will allow you to sync contacts, task and events in outlook.  Winter 07 release in SF has pop up reminders for both events and tasks.  This might be limited to the SF subscription you have so you might want to call customer support or seek further info from a SF admin in your organization.
Quote Templates: Page Formatting,Chris Kryzan,Under Consideration,7750,16,None,**going,This is a need. If a quote is gooing to look professional there needed to be a way to control where there is a line break. Right now I have times where a line break will be created in the middle of a quote line item and it will leave half on the first page and the rest at the very top under the header. Adding spaces and adjusting the header and footer only do so much. Please consider this idea.,I am a brand new SalesForce customer, and having read all the comments I am a bit disappointed now. I have never thought Salesfoce to be so unprofessional in creating beautiful and customer friendly quote pdf's. Most of the SalesForce UI is made with a huge portion of love for the details. Why are the details in case of quote formatting are that neglected?,I posted in here a year ago. Any progress? ,None,I am a new user/admin with Salesforce and I'm surprised that some of this basic functionality is not built in to the Salesforce platform.  Formatting quotes seems like a basic function but I have to buy an app to do this?  Seems like a bait and switch because I heard such good things about Salesforce prior to using the system.  I wouldn't say I have buyer's remorse but it's getting close.  Page breaks and row text alignment would help make the quotes look more professional.,If we are already using DocuSign, can we just have DocuSign generate the PDF instead before we send it out for e-signature?  I have not looked into it yet but was wondering if anyone know if DocuSign could merge fields from the Salesforce Quotes object onto the PDF," generating a PDF dynamically each time we have a quote?  Then the user would just need to click the ""Send with DocuSign"" button and it's associated with the Quote.  Am I way off here or is this possible using DocuSign templates and merge fields?",Page breaks and better formatting options are a must for Salesforce Quotes. Without these customizations, we are required to pay for apps and/or not use the Quotes. :(,This is becoming a bigger and bigger issue for us. Our quotes look ridiculous with large gaps between texts and confusing page breaks. We really need this.  ,None,None,None,@Marcus Fields makes an excellent point.  Letter sized paper is only used in the USA and Canada.  If you want to create a quote to be printed anywhere else in the world, you need A4.  Is SalesForce really that US-centric?,None,Page break absolutely needed.  Thank you.
Mass update the default recordType,Guy Clairbois,Product Team Review,3340,15,By mistake created a record type first which is marked as 'Default' for all profiles by default.  Unable to delete the record type now.  It is really tidious task to update 100 profiles now in the system.  ,Agreed. Please implement ASAP. Would love if SF could take one release to work on these types of improvements rather than release new functionality.,This is such a big annoyment, great idea guy.,Sad.,Bizarre we can mass assign on creation but have to go through multiple profiles later on... give it another 5 years and we might get a comment from Product Management to say it's on the roadmap.,The bulk change of a default record type with many profiles needs a lot of time at the moment,Very much overdue.  Updating rts (or any permissions) across profiles is horrible at the moment.,Very cumbersome - especially when cleaning up an org with many profiles.,Definitely very inefficient in orgs that have a large amount of profiles and you need to change the default record type for all.,Very annoying.,Agreed, very painful when dealing with multiple profiles,Could it be as simple as mimicing the field level security on each field?,I think this will be very useful. I have 272 profiles that got assigned a recordtype I now want to remove in DEV and I'm stuck.,Same need... +1000,Agreed!
IsChanged function in Apex,Oxene Oxene,Under Point Threshold,1590,15,None,This would be so helpful. And also reduce the number of lines of code needed.,We need this a lot !!!,This will be very helpful,+1,None,New and old value comparison impacts performance massively.,Will avoidn having to code for (extra lines) comparison between trigger.old and trigger.new,Yes, it will be very helpful,Oh this would be a huge time saver!  Please make it possible soon. ,None,Very helpful function.,This will save some codeing!,If the list class and the map class had a status method not just on triggers that would be best,Saves lot of time,code and especially script statements
Enhanced List Views - Inline Editing all Text fields (long/rich),Ben Hicks,Product Team Review,3680,15,This would be a great upgrade is there any update on the information?,Is there an update available on the status of this functional add?,None,Huge timesaver, needed ASAP!,Long text area has to be editable on List view. Hopeing that it will be at the earliest.,None,None,Definitely would love the long text area field to be inline editable. It's a real inconvenience to have to go into each record to make an update. ,None,yes please - its the one thing stopping us from delivering forecasting 100% through salesforce,Would be very helpful!,Great Idea. Should be there.,Please implement immediately or sooner. In exchange, I will bake you some chocolate chip cookies.,This is a must. A real time saver.,We currently have to duplicate membership information in a Google spreadsheet in order to track our work resolving membership issues, such as failed monthly payments. This is so inefficient and risky (high risk of error) that we're adding a Notes field to the membership object so we can add these notes in the View. But I don't know if it will work if we have only 255 characters. Thanks for considering this considerable improvement.
'Save & Send Update' button in event with invitees layout should be removable,Inbal Jait,Product Team Review,2840,15,This button needs to be removed as quickly as possible. There is a real risk that confidential information will be exposed through user error.,I have many internal requests for this!,Agreed!,... at least we would like to change it's position to the middle/right. Most people are used to the yes/no style action and automatically click the leftmost button to save their changes.,This button needs to be removed as quickly as possible. There is a danger that confidential information will be exposed through user error. It is imperitave that this button is optionally hidden from view. Users should also be able to control the sending of emails to meeting invitees themselves instead of having SFDC switch them off. This would make the recording of meeting activity much easier.,Everybody is afraid of using the application for internal notes... please do give the possibility of removing the button!,None,Agree.  I have a client who just experienced this very disaster.  Spent more hours during the last 2 days in meetings with security teams, legal and compliance depts, IT, the business, etc. that I care to count.,Please make this button removable. ,This is still a big ask from Clients!,Yes, please. Our team lives in fear of that button.,Please allow us to remove the button.,This would be a plus for our org.,Agreed. Disabling the 'Save and Send Update' button would be of great help for us.,We have been asking for this for YEARS!  And I see this idea was logged six years ago.  Hoping that Salesforce makes this functionality available sooner versus later!  We truly need this in our business as we have had VERY unfortunate problems occur when emails were sent to donors in error....
Out of Office Email Settings,Chris Mello,Product Team Review,2970,15,+1,None,PLEEEEEEEEEEEESE implement! ,This would be super helpful, as well as the ability to specify a delegate that would receive all of your notifications and take action on them as well (ex: Leads/Activities/Cases Assigned).,Is this enhancement slated for anytime soon?  We are getting pressure to have this implemented and would hate to develop a custom solution when we are attempting to get back to Out of The Box features.  Thanks!,This would be really handy to have! Please implement :),This would be really handy to have! Please implement :),Please add! I can't believe there hasn't been any internal implementation of this yet -- I'm sure there are a lot of people who would get great use out of this.,Please add. Would be useful for clients contacting us via Cases. ,I am surprised this feature doesnt exist - please implement!,A very basic requirement. I'm surprised Salesforce hasn't addressed this in over 4 years!,None,I have been wanting this feature from the start. Customers have no way of knowing they are updating an SR that is not being monitored.,This would be a really great feature to prevent cases being allocated to a user who is on leave,We would love this! Clients should know when reps are Out of the office. 
Require Continuation Callout in Lightning Components,Suresh Kumar Arjunan,Under Point Threshold,530,14,Need it ASAP.,We need  to make long running callouts in loghtning exp, this is very much required feature.,This is a key feature to overcome salesforce long-running transaction limits. We need that for LEX transition.,Definitely a must have. In my case, for a customer planning an extensive use of communities templates (Napili).,They should implement the interface for lightning as soon as they can. It´s very used on callouts!!,Must have before we can switch users to Lightning exp.,Very much needed for us to implement Lightning.,Very much needed for us to implement Lightning.,@Ciro, yep, I have build a generic wrapper around continuations for lightning that works in locker service.,None,Actually must to have if UI components have alot of users and require to work with data outside of SFDC. For now, I have to use continuation in JS Remoting framework, make a VF page, put it into iframe on a lighning compoent and build communication between iframe and lighning component using Window.postMessage. Ugly, but works.,nice to have,None,None
SalesForce Inbox - date format,AJ Salesforce Admin,Under Point Threshold,50,0
Allow Read Only FLS on object Owner field and hide Change link for profile users,Michael Groth,Under Point Threshold,200,3,If the Record Owner field is not available to a profile, via FLS, then the user should not have visiblity to the Change Owner icon.  This extends to Community Users/Profiles, and causes confusion to the users - the current functionality allows a user to click on something that will inevitably fail, which is cause for a bad user experience.,Hi Aiden-  In theory it should work, but our custom profiles have Transfer Record set to off and they still see the Change link.  It seems like having Edit permission at the object level overrides the Transfer Record permission.,None
Masking sensitive data after refresh of sandbox,Geert Adams,Under Point Threshold,470,11,This is very much needed!,This is a must for complex environments and is a real pain point, Salesforce should provide functionality for this.,None,This would be a great feature, nowadays data breaches are too common.,This would be a great feature. The manual labor that goes into somehting like this every time a sandbox is spun up is painful. ,Completely agree.  When your secret sauce is more than just PII and SPI, masking this data is critical and now required by some industry regulators (financial services).  Make it happen Salesforce!,None,None,None,thanks for your post Charlie. Obfuscation is exactly what we want to do. thanks,I would support this request, maybe with a little twist... not just masking certain data fields but Obfuscation of certain fields. I work in Fin Serv and the OCC has regulatory requirement that there can be no PII in any lower or Dev environment. We ned an obfuscation tool that allows us to identify fields in production that when perfrming a full data sandbox refresh they are obfuscated... format and length are maintained, but data is randomized or jumbled... but txt remains txt, alpha remains alpha and such. This would resolve the full data sandbox and traditionally all Dev sandbox data is derived from the full data sandbox that is already obfuscated.
Apex Lambda Expressions,Jeff Karp,Under Point Threshold,860,13,I like to use nested closures with lambda expressions to setup unit test data (C#).  You can build a tree structure of related entities in a single easy to read statement.,This would be really helpful +1,Competing with today's languages, this is an absolute necessity...even Java got it after decades ;) Upvote!,Please!,Yes, please!,Definetely, need this!,That would be a really nice feature to have.,Yes! ,I hope too !!,Yes, please!,None,I would like to have lambdas too!,None
Multiple Record Owners for Account and Contacts,Adam Ady,Product Team Review,2940,15,None,This issue is brought to my attention every quarter.  If this can be done it would be very helpful,Glad to find this idea and so many recent comments/votes!,I have posted this before but I am seeing a lot of comments being added to this idea lately so I thought it might be worth posting again.  We are a med device company with multiple divisions all selling into the same hospitals so we have the multiple owners scenario that several of you have mentioned below.  The solution we found is to use Territory Management," which is available to all of you for no extra charge.  You just need to enable it and set it up.   All of our Accounts are owned by a generic admin user and we don't even have the Owner field on the Account Page layout.  The Territory Management related list shows who all ""owns"" the account record and what their role is.   Reports and List Views can both be run for ""My Territory's Accounts"" or ""My Territory Team's Accounts"".    In our case we have a field for each division on the Account object that defines the Territory assignment and then the lowest level hierarchy rules use those fields to determine who ""owns"" what.  Then everyone above them in the Territory Mangement hierarchy inherits visibility to the Accounts of the users below them (this is independent of the role and forecast hierarchies).  You can assign more than one user to a territory as well as assign one Account to multiple territories.  This is so much better than trying to use Account Teams.  There is plenty of documentation online for how to set this up.",We are a medical staffing company that has medical provider customers with multiple specialties. Different representatives within our company work on different specialty teams, and a provider may work with multiple reps to be placed in open positions for multiple specialties. Right now we have to keep switching the record owner, which is causing problems with giving credit to the correct reps. Being able to have multiple record owners would be highly beneficial to us.,Gemma," what is difficult about it? Multiple people can own a relationship so it seems what you are saying is that there is an issue coming up with the business solution for this on the SF end. We need multiple owners because different users own different relationships. ""Getting an intro for your part of the business"" doesn't do anything for being assigned to the account along with others that are working on the account. 1 account in our enterprise is worked by many people at the same time because they are all from different business units selling different things. There may also be performance advisors assigned to the account and others like a digital advisors. Without this functionality the built in reporting and list view functionality of ""my ..."" is not useful.  ","We have many situations where there are different types of financial advisors that a single contact is working with so it would be helpful if the Trust advisor could run a report or see a list of ""my contacts"" and the Invesment advisor could run a report or see a list of ""my contacts"" that includes this same contact person as they work their book of business.",Multiple owners of an account is difficult as there is usually somebody owning the overarching relationship which is something that the account team functionality gives us at the moment. The business challenge is always that you want to know if someone owns a relationship so you are not treading on their toes or you can contact them to get an introduction for your part of the business.,This would increase visibility, decrease duplication and prevent any incorrectly managed change of ownership - I can't see a downside.,This is really important. YES please!,None,A definite yes please, this would be incredibly helpful.,Definitely It's a must,Definitely It's a must,We really need the ability to have multiple owners for a single contact.
Process Builder: Clone the Criteria Step,Cheryl Besch,Product Team Review,2880,15,None,That would be great when building larger processes. ,I often have processes with multiple criteria that just changed subtly. Instead of having to create each one with almost identical criteria over, and over again... cloning or copying a criteria node would make life so much nicer,Would be  great time saver.,We may now have invocable Processes, but I don't think we'll ever get invocable criteria nodes.,Please,Yes please!,Great idea and would save a lot of pain,Yes please.,This would save so much time!!!,None,Voted!  This would greatly reduce time.,This would help to increase the productivity around the process builder and ease of development. ,Even if we could just clone the actions and not the full criteria node, it would be so helpful,Please, I need this right now.
Allow hyperlinks and formatting in the Dashboard description box.,Sonya Le,Under Point Threshold,830,9,Agreed!  This would help me make dashboards more informative for our users, driving adoption and improving efficiency.  This seems like such a simple ask, too.,Agreed.  I'd be happy with more than 255 characters.  When these are emailed to users, we cannot include any additional instructions besides what's in the description. Increasing the character limit should be an easy fix.,None,I like this idea. ,This would be very helpful.  Additionally I would appreciate the ability to add hyperlinks in the dashboard element footers.  I have a dashboard with metrics generalized to sales teams.  I would like to link to individual performance reports below the similar group dashboards.  ,Good idea. I'm working oon dashboard and this can be helpful,None,None,None
Country picklists only (leave the state out of it),Gorav Seth,Under Point Threshold,360,4,"I would appreciate having the country picklist without the state picklist. The current implementation is very ""West-centric"".",I think having the flexibility to choose to use just country picklists or country/state picklists would be super beneficial.,None,None
Warning messages,Rochelle Glover,Product Team Review,12480,16,All, the ability to dismiss a validation rule is not on the immediate roadmap. That said, the teams are exploring different ways to provide similar functionality. For example, providing you the ability to set a custom control that could override field control and enforce this type of validation. Discussions are ongoing, and we will provide more information as we have a concrete plan and timeline. ,Should be standard!,This is absolutely a must. ,The ability to simply bypass the validation rule would be ideal. Providing a custom control that could override field control doesn't strike me as being nearly so intuitive to the lay user.,None,If I scroll through the comments, I wonder if I can find my comment from 8 years ago.  As mentioned, lacking this basic functionality really gets in the way of implementing a simple process. ,These little things can make a significant difference in process management and the idea was brought to SF almost a decade ago. I'm getting tired of looking for solutions to problems and finding message boards like this where many other users want the same thing and its being ignored by salesforce. This should take a good developer maybe a day to program? maybe a couple more days for testing? Just do it already, make it an optional feature, what is there to discuss? ,What Pail Fris said.,Thanks for the info Jennifer, validation should always return true or false, but in some cases it could be useful to not immediately evaluate user input as right or wrong, but assist a user by providing a warning message or info message. Why can't this be achieved by introducing a validation type choice (block,warn,info) and the ability to dismiss the warning validation rule similar to the current duplicate [save (ignore)] functionality?,All, the ability to dismiss a validation rule is not on the immediate roadmap. That said, the teams are exploring different ways to provide similar functionality. For example, providing you the ability to set a custom control that could override field control and enforce this type of validation. Discussions are ongoing, and we will provide more information as we have a concrete plan and timeline. ,I hope this is still on someone's radar.,None,This would help considerably.,None,Yes! omg this would be sooooo useful,None
"Approval Process - Removal of ""Submit for Approval"" button after a record is app",Jon Keener,Under Consideration,4590,16,All, unfortunately there is nothing on the short-term roadmap that would address this idea. For the time being it will remain on the backlog to be considered for future releases. I will be sure to let you know if anything changes. ,None,And like I said a year ago, does it take 6yrs to get a deficiency that affects many customers resolved?  So far its been over 6. Your feature request cycle is the worse I've seen especially when the request comes from system admins like myself.  ,None,We need this also as users get confused when seeing this button on already approved records.,None,Controling Page Layout by Record Type values is too limitted, an dif used for this case would be opposite the idea that Record Type is used to control which Business Model is used for which type of object (Opportunity, Account, etc.),We really need the ability to remove or hide the Submit for Approval button.  It causes so much confusion for the users.,A generalized way to control the page layout that is seen based on field values would be what is needed. That would allow this, and any case where different layouts are needed.,Yes this would be a great addition. Letting us remove it from the related list like other buttons would be sufficient. The fact that there is no way to control the error feedback makes this a bigger problem. The user just gets a random error with no detail as to why they can't submit their thing for approval, and it leads to a bad user experience.,This is really needed.,None,+1,This is really needed.,Sometimes, we need do the validation and give proper message before submit, if this button can be removed, we can implement this with custom button instead.,we have the same need
A List or Report on what records I am following in Chatter,Jean Velonis,Under Consideration,10620,16,Hi Manpreet- this feature is on our backlog but the product manager was unable to share a confirmed ETA at this time. I'll keep actively tracking on this until we have something more solid to share. Thank you for your patience.,If using this for following accounts/opportunities, this is a big oversight. Users would like to be able to manage their lists if their territories or focus changes. ,This seems like a miss from the original implementation.  We're having issues with full roll out of Chatter if people can't easily see what Accounts they follow.  Please fix!,Alot of our users have asked for this too. Please make this available soon. I need to keep my users interested in using chatter and this will help with our user adoption. ,Highly useful.  Any update on when it can be released?,Also make it easy to unfollow items.  This would make Chatter more useful1,1,016 votes, 208 commments, and no word from SF on the dev status in a year?  How far back is that burner?,Any update when this will be delivered?,It would also be good if you could report on number of chatters by object,None,Useful if a user has reached the maximum number of records and wants to unfollow old records in order to follow new records.  Otherwise there does not seem to be an efficient way to do it.  ,Agreed with everything said by Colin Stennett.  The follow list today provides no value when trying to manage dozens of open cases.  The reasons for using the follow feature are two-fold: 1) Getting chatter updates even when you're not tagged; 2) Track cases that were entered by others, not assigned to you," but are pertinent to your accounts.  Have a dedicated list for ""followed"" cases in the same format as the ""Cases"" management page - including data like subject", client name/id, entered date, etc. - would be immensly helpful.,This is required if a user wants to unfollow old records in order to 'follow' new records once the user reached max criteria...,Would be good to have an update on this idea, seems like this sort of thing should be available.,Agreed Bernard - the list available via the Overview Tabs only gives a vague summary of what records you are following - in my case I am following dozens of Cases and this basic list only gives the case number on the display - no mention of the associated Accounts, Products, Case Contacts or Case Description etc involved. You would need to click on each single Case number to actually find out what the case number refers to. Fine to manage if you have only a few records to follow, impossible if you are following dozens or hundreds of cases. So the online list is not practical to use for me in its current limited format. Being able to simply create a report where 'Cases I Am Following' is a selectable option would allow everyone to build their own reports to resolve this issue.,None
Make Library have full function in Lightning,Johan Yu,Under Point Threshold,10,0
Lightning Experience: Document tab,Johan Yu,Under Point Threshold,590,6,Struck by lightning again! Had to search for ten minutes to figure this out! Thanks community :) ,None,I have tried looking up an image I saved in Documents today so I could use it in my letterhead, as my organization's name as changed and we need a new letterhead TOMORROW, but neither Classic nor Lightning will let me attach the new image to my letterhead.  Letterhead will only look up old documents.  This needs to be fixed immediately!,None,At the least, the icons for an app are stored in Documents and so sould be available.  I added it to the tabs but it still doesn't show.,None
Collision Detection,PDP ShoreAdmin,Product Team Review,4910,15,Hasn't anyone figured out that SF could care less about this CRITICAL PROBLEM.  Honestly, it is a total disgrace...but hey, they have our money and until we start leaving and making their stock go the other directiohn, NO ONE WILL LISTEN!,this is critical for the business as we process a lot of leads on a daily basis. , Quick and efficient managment of Leads is essential to our organisation.  Staff have KPIs around response time to Leads.  The frequency of the collision detection errors is reducing their effectiveness.  It is really crazy that this situation still exists after 2 years!,This is a much needed feature. This is impacting our Sales team. There is a ghost in our org!,None,I'm getting a big headache from my sales team on this - please fix ASAP,Any advantages of Pardot are spoiled by the crippling of Lead editing.  Fix this......,Please can you fix this issue. A big frustration and a lot of time wasted because of this!,None,None,None,None,This is really critical issue to be addressed by Saleforce on top priority. Business may move to some other crm tool if this is not really sorted out.,I can't believe this is still just an IDEA! My organization is struggling big time, and its not because two people are in the same record, but because they can't save records due to syncing with Pardot!  Please FIX this ASAP!,None
Visual Workflow / Flow translation for labels and fields,Kevin Sheridan,Under Point Threshold,1210,15,None,None,None,None,Much needed. ,We would like to see this feature. It is very much needed in a corporation operating around the globe.,None,With the increased attention on flows, there will be greater use, and so we really need to have the labels and choices translated easily.  We were going to add some flow functionality to our instance to solve some business issues, but keeping it translated in all 11 languages looks like will make flow a showstopper for us.,Since you can't use custom labels, the only solution I have found is to use custom settings. I have the flow start by passing a variable with the ID of the current user, then I can query the user's language setting in the flow. Once I have that I can pull the strings for that language from the custom setting I set up and assign each of them to a flow variable. Then I just use the variables in the UI and it works. It's an awful workaround though.,though salesforce have visual workflow feature we can't utilize effectively because of translation. I hope Salesforce consider this and provide translation in next release. ,please, it seems to be a massive over-sight for an otherweise excellent feature.,must have feature to be able to use Flow in a bi or multi lingual setting,Is there any update from Product Management on this Idea?  With all of the great features coming out for Flow in the coming releases, I believe it is going to become a significant part of the administrators toolbox.  As such, anyone working in a global organization is going to need the ability to translate screen elements in Flow just like they do for the field labels (among other things) on standard page layouts and in Visualforce.,None,very helpful and really needed!
Set scale on second axis in lightning chart,Jorrit Droogsma,Under Point Threshold,1790,16,Thanks all for your feedback. We are working on bringing this functionality to Lightning as soon as possible. Bar and line combo chart on a single axis is going to be available in June with the Summer'17 release. We are working on Line+Line combo chart and it should be available in October with the Winter'18 release (Safe Harbor). ,None,None,Please can it also be available for cumulative line charts (as it is in classic)?,Thanks all for your feedback. We are working on bringing this functionality to Lightning as soon as possible. Bar and line combo chart on a single axis is going to be available in June with the Summer'17 release. We are working on Line+Line combo chart and it should be available in October with the Winter'18 release (Safe Harbor). ,None,None,It is impossible to do comparitive reporting without this feature. For a professional services example, my billable utilization looks to be greater than my total utilization (total = billable + productive). VERY misleading. ,This is making it very hard for our users to understand how they are performing when they look at the charts which completlely alleviates the need for the chart. Currently we have removed all lightning charts and have special training for the users to explain to them that the charts cannot be trusted at a glance as the axis are wildly different,I noticed this on my Month To Date product dashboard as well. I didn't not realize there was a difference in scale, so I was incorrectly assessing my product's sucess for this month compared to the previous year. Must have fix. ,We need it. No way to compare sales of current year vs previous year without that feature !,None,All Salesforce is doing is forcing me to use other tools like Tableau and Excel. This is hurting their brand and therefore should escalate this issue.,"This is a MUST and is why I have yet to open out our target v actual reports to our users (because it provides misleading information to whoever is reading the chart). I am disappointed this has not been recorded as a ""known issue"".",This is a huge deal if our Org wants to switch to Lightning. Bar Charts cannot have more than 1 X/Y Axis, still can't change bar chart colors, Tables cannot have more than 2 columns, no Dashboard filters, Cannot use Percentages as a measuse for Gauge charts. These issues should have been address long before Lightning was launched.,This is a big deal when metrics aren't correct in a Big Data world. Analysts who create, pull, crunch and dive into KPI metrics before they get sent further up the chain should be shouting for this to be accurate in every way. This is a key part of many Admin jobs and a Salesforce platform advantage to make the black/white 0's and 1's of piles of good data into colorful charts that are easy to analyze and make data driven decisions. Please help get these up and running 100% so we can put our trust in the metrics in LEX. Thank you, ds.
OpportunityLineItem SortOrder to be Creatable/Updatable,Jason Venable,Product Team Review,2870,16,None,None,None,I don't quite understand why this property is not writable seems to and simple property, the fact that it is locked make me question the flexiblity of plateform, increase the amount work needed to create a whole new visualforce as oppose to just a basic  apex trigger.,*sigh* -- another tiny limitation that is causing innumerable hours of unnecessary work at my company. When working with such a flexible platform, quirks like this make me scratch my head and think," ""Really?""",I did try opening a case but it was closed with the comment that we need to have premium support to be considered,None,"Abillity to write to Sortorder field is a requirement for us.  We need to sort by custom line number field.  We want to set the sort order to match the custom line number. we are using the custom script described at https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000008zkRIAQ but this workaround requires a custom javascript button that will not be available in Lightning. The ""delivered solution"" for sorting in Lightning is not a solution for us", as that is just a view sort: we need 'fixed sorting' based on our custom line numbers.  If we could write to sortorder without having to inject data into lineitemsort.jsp, life would be so much easier for integration.,None,This is such a fundamental and required functionality! My org frequently builds sales consisting of hundreds of line items. This lack of ability is making Salesforce adoption not only difficult but hard to make sound convincing.,None,+1   ...needs to be fixed.  I say fixed, because not being able to sort a related list the way I want = broke in my eyes.  I'm amazed that I can't even address this with apex code and even more amazed this has gone unhandled by Salesforce for so many years.,None,Desperate for the SortOrder field to be updateable - our product line items are NOT in alphabetical order and bulk updates make manually adjusting the sort order for each opportunity's line item a ludicrous solution.,None,Can't believe this has been going on so long.  Seems like a no brainer...
Transfer Notes & Attachments to another object,Dominic Lucia,Partial Delivery in Winter '16,4150,16,None,None,None,None,This would be a HUGE timesaver! ,None,Attachments are the critical one for us.,Is this feature, of transferring attachments from one object to other, still not available yet?,None,None,None,Will this also allow people who own the record but not neccesarily the creators of the records(Created by) to delete records that they own but not have created.,It seems there is a lot of progress on this idea so that's really promising.  I only stumbled onto this idea today because I have been doing a feasibility analysis of an initiative and part of that initiative involves moving notes & attachments on a custom object over to a standard object.  To be more specific, when we purchased salesforce our implementation partners recomended we use a custom object for our opportunities.  As time goes on we realize just what a bad idea that was, and we really want to move the details stored in our custom objects into newly created standard opportunity objects.  One of the key issues I am facing is how to move over notes & attachments on the custom objects to the corresponding standard objects.  Anyhow, I voted for this idea in general even though the direction the implementation of the idea is taking doesn't seem like it will really help in my current predicament.  ,None,None,Has it got deployed??
Only Show Joined Report Results for Records on both Sides,Joseph Yelle,Product Team Review,5580,15,Yes please!,"""Failure"" is an apt moniker for how I feel when my search takes me to this ""success"" site. Hopefully Watson's big data functionality suggests that SF management prioritize adding SQL join functionality to Joined Reports. Wave Analytics a tough upsell to anyone who notices how crucial functionality is left out of the core flagship product and is afraid to learn what other crucial functionality will be neglected in Wave.",None,this is critical to make joined reports useful.,Need this for gap analysis,Would be nice if this was also available in Lightning. ,This shouldn't be considered a feature, this should be a standard when looking at a relational database.  Explaining why this can't be done and trying to find work arounds is costing my business far too much money, manpower, and stress.,How has this been a request for 4 YEARS and not been implemented?  Seriously, SFDC, you need to get some of these OBVIOUS NEED requests done.,Especially considering that you can't export joined reports, it would be fantastic to be able to inner join inside salesforce, saving an excel export and manipulate.,None,+1,Very little use for joint reports without this feature ,Too much limitations of using Joined Reports. Please enable this.,Need this feature in the worst way,Join Reports are not very useful without this.
Allow Web-to-Case to support Case Attachments,Garrett Farwell,Under Consideration,8990,16,None,None,9 years.  This would be so helpful.  A shame basic overdue improvements like this take a back seat to flashy new products.,Dont implement this, developers still need work... point and clickers can wait...,We need this feature to avoid going to a complex solution like sites, Visualforce etc. Web-to-Case fucntionality is a wonderful functionality and it would be helpful we can do additional things like attahchments, validation etc.,YES please!,None,Almost embarrassing that SF has not implemented this....,Very much needed! Please implement this,None,Please add this functionality. It should be a basic functon in the Web-to-Case forms. Many cases require attachements/proof of what is going on. Our company would like to see this offered.,This is a much desired function; even if it was a callback that generated a customized followup email that allowed customers to reply-via-email attachments to an address that auto-attached them to the Case record, that would be helpful.,We would LOVE to have this functionality at our company so that submitters of a case can add attachments rather than having to email them in, where they could potentially get lost. ,We would LOVE to have this functionality at our company so that submitters of a case can add attachments rather than having to email them in, where they could potentially get lost. ,Please add this capability.. Thanks. ,I had tasked my IT with coming up with this process and assumed SF had a way to allow this information (files) into the web to case scenario. Apparently I should not assume functionality at all. Unfortunate this has been on the radar for this long with no real progress.
Salesforce.com should do virus scan on all the uploaded files,Anil Gandhi,Product Team Review,2630,15,This is MUST MUST have feature,  we are unable to roll out many good features to our clients due to these security blockers!   Awaiting SFDC product team's firm answers / response on this one.  many thanks.,It is a must and my Insurance client want to have it in place while choosing Salesforce...,It's a shame that security wholes do need to wait for enough votes until getting fixed.,None,For all HealthCare Clients, this is an absolute must have!,F-Secure Cloud Protection for Salesforce keeps the malware out and users protected. It gets outstanding customer reviews and support from Salesforce! Check out the latest: https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/press_global/news/news-archive/-/journal_content/56/1075444/1964592?p_p_auth=HqT0sMLj ,None,Our clients consider this a security threat. Please add this service to the platform. Thank you.,please implement this ,For government customers of all stripes, this is increasingly going to become an issue," and Salesforce needs to address it soon. Agencies that require ATOs or other security measures will eventually find this lack of scanning disqualifying for Salesforce as a tool. And I""m not talking long term- probably within the next few years.  I have to apply for a security exception to get approval to use Salesforce at this point because it lacks this feature. It probably will no longer be granted in a couple of years- possibly even next year. ",I agree with Brian, this should be part of the SaaS model service,I can get votes on this, but does Salesforce really want me to advertise this to get the votes?  Seems like a security item like this shouldn't need many votes.,Much needed feature.,Definitely a must for many clients...,Much needed feature.
List Views / Filter MyTasks in Lightning Experience,Manuela Kirschner,Under Point Threshold,230,4,This is at 2550 points if merged with https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000LjIQAA0,None,Great idea!!!,Fully agree. We should be able to create new views on Tasks in Lightning. Or at least, display in Lightning the custom views created in Classic on Tasks
Ability to notify users when the Org's data storage exceeds certain limit,Jithendra Koduru,Under Point Threshold,1950,15,None,Storage Helper not only sends the alerts, it will automatically recycle data for you. You can install it free from the AppExchange: https://goo.gl/4jhhHM,Definitely a must have feature.,Desperately needed!,+1,None,This should be standard out-of-the-box feature.,This would be really beneficial,"+1 to Jeff Davis' comment: We need the ability to configure system alerts with custom thresholds."" ",Definitely a must have feature.,Great idea! It is really required.,this feature is a must,This is particularly important if storage is added as needed and the distance between available and used is always close.  It should be customizable for each customer to choose their threshhold level.  Two thumbs, straight up.,great idea!.  I recently got surprised when our org was very close to max storage.  other than the inconspicuous alert message on set up page, doesn't seem to be any other alerts.,This is a must have for admins !!!
Make the Manage External User button available in lightning,Danny Ross,Product Team Review,2820,15,This is a must have for our institution.,YES please!!! this is very frustrating in being able to use Lightning all the time and time consuming to switch back and forth,We are considering moving to Lightning, but we use this button frequently!,This is critical functionality and can not be left behind in Classic!,Very important idea ,Very Necessary piece of key functionality ,Clearly a must for Community Cloud customers willing to activate Lightning...,Great idea,Please we need to be bale to transfer our orgs to lightning,very helpful!!,very helpful!,Extremely required!,Very helpful requirement!,Pls consider for inclusion as it is difficult to explain to customers why they need to switch to classic for this functionality.,Please make LEX comfortable and provide solution for such useful features in LEX:
Process Builder: selection of multiple picklist/text values in one filter,Joy Wallis,Under Point Threshold,1900,15,None,Something that I wasn't aware of, but which is probably my fault for not reading the documentation, is that Process Builder processes have SOQL limits similar to that of Apex triggers. My process is pretty complex and kept hitting the query limit, causing the process to abort midway through. As such, my recommendation for anyone who anticipates building a complex process is that they should write an Apex trigger instead, as you will then have full control as to the number of queries being performed. Of course the downside here is that you will need to know how to write Apex code.,Nice.,None,It's astonishing that this functionality is missing...,@Tyler Harris, great tip!,None,Salesforce please can we fix the shortcomings detailed in the many posts below.  I assume 'Under points threshold' means you will kick it into the long grass for years to come, however it would be nice if you address this promptly.,"I want ""does not contain"" too. If a picklist has two chosen values"," A and B. Then if I say ""does not equal A"" then that evaluates as true"," whereas ""does not contain A"" evaluates as false.",None,None,Cannot use process builder until this is modified to use multiple criteria in a single filter. As a higher education customer, we do assinments based on something called a CEEB code - similar to a SIC code. We have cases where several hundred CEEB codes belong to a single counselor - i will NOT create a filter for every single one. Back to workflow we go... ,I hope you all take into consideration that something is underutilized like process builder because of stuff like this and DO NOT force it to have as high of a point threshold to do any review.  I am a Process Builder evangelist, but things like this just make it frustrating for folks trying to migrate from Workflow Rules.  There you can just do something like [picklist_field EQUALS Value 1, Value 2].  Sure would be nice to do that in Process Builder as well.  ,I need the ability to create a condition which checks that a certain value is NOT selected in a multi-select picklist," even if there are multiple other values selected in it. I need ""does not contain"" as an operator"," not just ""contains"".",A must, please!
Improve format of scheduled reports,Kirstie Paul,Product Team Review,4190,15,This Idea posted 7 Years ago and still no response on it. :-/,Please make this happen!,None,I am so disappointed with the almost unreadable format.  ,Current output is unusable,Improvements are definitely needed...,Scheduled Report is not readable. It's like too fuzzy, cells are not alligned and also format is not so good.,Current email schedule is not readable at all ! Do we have to wait again 7 years to see improvements on this part ?,None,I love Salesforce, but exported reports and report deliveries via subscription look as if they should still be in a test environment - as if a developer had just finished the proof of concept confirming the export reporting features before development went on to work the actual formatting issues.  As mentioned earlier, the lack of care here hurts trust with the business when you're trying to convince new users/managers the benefits of Salesforce when reporting looks so unattractive and/or when users have to manually format in Excel - largely defeating the use of Salesforce.,Format in email needs to be improved. My C-Suite is always asking questions because it just is not clear to those that are not living and breathing these reports. If the data could be stretched out in the email view by double it was be a huge improvement. ,None,None,This really needs some attention.  We have business users that are looking at purchasing other products when all we need to do is improve the format of the existing feature within Salesforce.,None
Salesforce1 Admin login as another user,Preston Galarneau,Product Team Review,4270,15,How is this not possible!!!,Indeed!,Agreed!,This would help greatly.  Please add!,An important trobleshooting functionality.,Very imporatant for troubleshooting the functionality avilable for users in salesforce1. Please prioritize this as soon as possible.,Thanks for the idea. This is becoming more and more needed every day. ,Very important... we have to call each other to test or see their user experience.,This is very important!  Please add this ASAP. ,please add,I wonder if we will have to wait 10 years for this.,Why is this not a feature? This is needed. Very soon.,This would be a very helpful feature as we work at increasing our Salesforce1 adoption. ,That would be very useful!,This is needed as most of our users are on Ipads and its difficult to test SF1 app.
URL field longer than 255 characters,Vanessa Voisard,Product Team Review,2770,15,Badly needed!,Please increase this limit beyond 255 chars!,Need this ...Really missing .,None,Please do not forget that this is needed in Communities, too! I cannot use the External URL function of the Navigation component becasue of this limitation....would be nice if I could.,the URL field length needs to be increased.,The Url field legnth needs to be increased. We are not able to store more than 25 characters url.,Pls extend beyond 255 characters !  ,Yes please update this field. Whilst we have the option of changing the field to text, it's not user friendly. ,None,Also need this,None,None,None,None
Manage Queues Permission,Tim Rehm,Product Team Review,3970,15,Much Needed,This permission is very much required and will help our business users manage their work wiith raisung tickets with the support team.,Managing queue members by delegated admin will benefit our company a lot.  We have a lot of support cases requesting add and/or remove user(s) from a queue. ,"I don't understand why you would need the permission ""Customize Application"" in order to add/remove users from a queue. This obviously grants more permissions than what you want to assign", such as editing lead settings, creating/editing/deleting workflow rules among many others. Please create a stand alone permission for queue management. ,The queues should be able to be managed via the Omni Supervisor. Just like in any phone system where a supervisor can manage who is on which queue.,Some of a Salesforce customers business users need to manage case queues. Currently they are giving admin permissions to some of thier business users as there was no way to give only queue admin permissions. They want a way to specifically give queue admin permissions to business users?,This is verymuch needed, as we have users to rune rules on Territory Management, but they do not need to have Customize Application permission on their profiles. ,This is really needed as Admins can't keep doing this and not everyone can be given the Admin privileges.,This is needed!,This enhancement woud save many hours for non-admins sending over requests to admins to have these types of changes completed and for admins who end up spending extra time making these changes when it shoud really be in the power of the manager of the queue (end user) to have this ability as they are the ones who are requesting this frequently.,None,We can't give access  to people who manage  only  a part of  our Salesforce solution.   Please amend  this.,This is a request we hear a lot from our Remedyforce customers for the same reason.  They don't want to give full access, but let regions manage Queue membership.,How does this not exist? This should not require full admin access to update a queue.,None
Lookup Relationship Fields related to Specific Record Type,Lorenzo Castelli,Under Point Threshold,780,8,Would be really helpful.....,would be really helpful....,None,Useful function which is missing,This is critical, missing functionality. Even a formula field that results in the lookup record type name cannot be chosen in the field to 'equal' the related object record type name.,Lookup filters are frustrating. Why don't they work as expected? This feature request seems simple enough. Why is this so hard!!!,This is a similar problem to what my organization would like.Is it possible to have a page layout with look up relationshipsfor partners(other accounts) and have the ability to pull their account type onto the page layout ? I would like a layout similar to the one above,but on the account view.It is valuablefor our organization to be able to view account 's partners and their account type. Any ideas ? ,yet another request for this functionality, which was supposedly delivered in Summer 2008 edition.Why stop at record types(though if I had to choose one field you could filter on, that would be my choice too) ?Where a lookup field is inserted into a page layout,we just need to be able to store a few parameters(just like on a custom View),"such as""account type equals 'distributor' AND Dead equals 'False'"".There are too many other items on this theme to mention."
Process Builder Actions duplicate, move and dependencies,Allison Beltran,Under Point Threshold,310,7,Much needed. So much time has been wasted copying nearly exact actions within a PB manually. Then to have it break because of one typo. If it exists in flow dont know why it cant exist in PB.,None,Cloning immediate actions would be a huge time saver. Also greatly reduces human error when creating numerous actions.,this would be very useful, especially when you are building a process with multiple criteria & slight differences in the actions, ,These changes would make Process Builder so much easier to use.,Yes, this is very necessary.  Process Builder is not easy to use now.,None
Process Builder - Ability to define field updates as BEFORE or AFTER INSERT,Blake Hunter,Under Point Threshold,460,9,"I agree. This will increase performance of flows in the process builder. Sometimes we really need to make some changes in records in ""before insert"" manner without DML-operations", because they cause recursive call of all triggers, workflows, processes for an SObject.,This will for sure reduce time spent in writing triggers for simple operations.,It would reduce the need to write a trigger for simple cases., like populating CreatedBy value to a user lookup field. Since createdby doesnt have any value until afetr insert, Process builder doesnt seem to work.Please provide this ability.,challenges with other vendors managed packages withotu the ability to force execution timing. This is needed !!!!,Will be very helpful if we can call apex code using process builder to populate fields before inserting the record.,Being able to fine tune the firing of the Process Builder will go a long way to helping replace triggers in our org. ,This very much needed inorder to avoid triggers and effectively use salesforce out of box features,Yes, please add this feature!!!,I'm running into this during lead conversion. My VWF that Process Builder is firing, is running on the BEFORE, NOT the AFTER the Opportunity creation. I can't get the ContactID from a ContactRole based on the lead conversion order of operations. 
Ability to pass Dashboard filters by URL (?pv0= functionality in reports),Spencer Collins,Product Team Review,8450,15,None,Must-have feature.   Please.,This would be a very useful feature and would save a lot of our dashboard admin. Our use case is for filtering a case metrics dashboard for each account via a URL link.,This solution also needs to be supported in Salesforce1. ,This would be really very usefull and is a real added value for our team ansd customers!!!!,must have for team dashboards.,Please!  Many different use cases but now must build dashboard with all possible filter values loaded ahead of time.,Basic functionality that should be enabled...standard in other reporting mediums.,You would think after 4 years this would have been implemented.  What is the status of this?  I would love to see this feature as this will save on having to build identical reports.  ,None,This would enable user-oriented dashboards.,i confirm it's a must have to perform usefull dashboards,This would be extremely useful.,This feature is needed.,This is much needed. Please consider.
On-demand email-to-case design flaw,Connector-SFDC,Under Consideration,3200,16,None,This is a big problem for us, as our customers attach large files in emails to us.,None,+1,None,This is needed in any company that deals with engineering and manufacturing.   Ofter customers or clients send in a help inquiry with drawings and docuementation attached.   Our own sales liteature is too large to attach on an incoming customer email if they are trying to point out a question on our products.    Please allow these inquiries to come into On Demand Case to support our business.,None,is there any current workaroung on that? like an auto response to the sender that we didn't receive it?,None,None,I completely agree, Service must be made aware of an incoming email to case even in the event the attachment was too large.  Not creating a case = dealyed response = customer dissatisfaction.  To earlier points made, Salesforce should strip off the attachment and create a new case with some indication the attachment was removed.,Definitely required.  This cause our agents a lot of extra work tracking down which e-mails made it to cases and which didn't because of attachment size issues.,It is strongly needed.,Good idea,This continues to cause issues as a Case is not created and no notification is sent to the customer or support.  Customer gets upset as they believe that we are not meeting SLA.,This causes particular issues when the client is using a cloud-based email such as google rather than exchange because they can't even install the email to case toolkit behind their firewall. This leaves them without any other options.
Case Merge Button,Rod Boileau,Under Consideration,13190,16,None,None,Hello - update on this please :),Can we get an updated status on this Case Merge idea?  Thanks!,i just moved in from Freshdesk," a helpdesk solution. the ""case"" merge feature is available in their entry level subscription. $19 per month per user. Come on Salesforce!",None,This would be a valuable tool for our team in handling case management. Hope you can make this happen soon!,This would be a great addition!,I find it redicoulous that salesforce don't have case merge - this is a basic faeture of a support crm. this is out of the box in zendesk. need it asap.,Would love to see this feature.....,Any developments on this yet??? This would be super helpful for us!,The is a key feature for keeping our data and reporting clean in Salesforce.,This is absolutely needed. In our fast-paced customer service environment, we get duplicate case s all the time. It is a pill to copy all the information from duplicate cases into one.,None,This is really an important function to have - just like how we merge accounts and contacts right now. This should be looked at soon as this function is essential to Support Teams who are using Service Cloud.,@kristie garafola: any update since your last featured message, one year ago? There's about 12k worth of points right now, and obviously we'd prefer having this as a native robust Salesforce feature instead of having to purchase a third party solution. Thank you!
Be able to delete users,Faisal Misle,Product Team Review,8070,15,MUST BE DONE TO ENSURE GDPR COMPLIANCE,None,Yes, please.,Understanding that the inability to delete system users makes sense for auditing purposes--please at least allow deletion of Community users. ,We have a process to make contacts users so they can log into communities and print a membership card, but many never do. When they leave the company, we remove them from the company list. Because they have a user record, we cannot delete the contact record. So it is taking up data in our contacts as well. These are users with nothing connected to them.,atleast provide a functionality to quarantine the users, such that they dont appear in searches, reports, extracts etc...,None,Thinking aloud, inability to effectively delete the user record will be an issue with the EU GDPR regulations coming in effect from May 2018, one of the provisions of which is right to erasure of personal information.,I partially agree with @Houston Barnett, admins should be able delete users which have never logged but this does not make sense delete users if they are linked to some records, posts from chatter or other parts of systems. ,I feel system admin should have user deletion abilites.  Not being able to delete users is a huge hardship on our organization.  We have 2 active orgs that we alternate using for a school year.  When one is being activly used," the other is being prepared for the next school year.  The majority of the users vary from year to year so having them removed when the associated org is ""cleaned out"" is a best practice.  It seems very mucky keeping in old user records and adding in new ones.  Not to mention the issue it may cause with user name", alias and nickname when doing a mass upload.,None,None,None,None,None
Global Picklists and Standard Fields,Chris Lance,Under Point Threshold,170,1,None
Field Update - Lookup Field!,Matt Pestritto,Partial Delivery in Spring '15,13340,16,None,We really, really, need this for territory assignment rules.,This is very much required with Workflows..,Still need this for workflow. C'mon Salesforce!,This really needs to be basic workflow functionality.  At the very least, allow us to clear a lookup field from Field Updates.  ,None,Our Remedyforce customers have also run into a number of challenges (many already mentioned below) in regards to Process Builder.  Probably the biggest is the inability to bulkify an entire single process.  If you have custom triggers that are built based on Salesforce best practices to prevent recurssion we've seen problems due to the level of bulkification.  Another option is to use Flows," but sometimes that's a bit ""too"" heavy.",This seems so basic...why is it lacking?,I like the overall capability of the process builder, but my issue is that workflow rules do not adhere to governor limits with regard to a single transaction on an object but the process builder does. I.e. using the process builder for too much automation causes the 100-SOQL query limit to be reached extremely often, giving errors throughout the system. On the other hand, no such issue comes up with extensive automation using workflow rules,None,Nothing for Classic users?,None,Process builder handles all references!,I'd like to say that I'm surprised that this huge limitation has been left unaddressed for over seven years... but sadly I'm not at all...,How come this very useful idea have not been considered yet. ,None
Bucketing Upgrade,Jonathan Bussone,Product Team Review,3770,15,PLease include wildcards or contains!,Yes, please add wildcard search functionality for buckets,None,None,It would be very helpful to include functionality to add currently null values into a text bucket field - in my example I am reporting on sales activity by owner. Joe Bloggs has not currently got any activities under his name and so cannot be added to a bucket field.,None,All necessary items!,Strongly agree with #s 2 & 3 on this suggestion!  Upgrades to the bucketing feature are needed & long overdue.  Salesforce, with your reputation & talent pool, it is inexcusable to have your users exporting data to Excel for additional manipulation. This is a potentially great feature with severe limitations.  Put some shine on it!,"Very inflexible without wildcards.  Please add ""Contains"" functionality to vastly improve the usefulness of the bucketing feature.",None,Please increase the limitations for bucket fields.  This feature would be so beneficial for our business to steamline reporting.,This is definitely needed for our business to streamline reporting!,Please, please, please implement #2 and #3...oh my goodness this would make life easier!,Yet another obvious fix that's been on these boards for years. Can someone at Salesforce actually make these requests happen? There are some critical updates that will really improve our work, including this one.,Agreed, wildard or contains when bucketing text fields would be extremely helpful. +1!
Option to download Salesforce Certificate Online,Uvais Komath,Under Point Threshold,20,1,This is much needed!!
Add Trendline to Bar/Stack Charts,CaptainSpammer,Product Team Review,2960,16,Happy Monday Community members! Thank you for your feeback, votes and comments. This Idea has reached point threshold and our PM organization will be actively reviewing it as a potential feature. The team should be able to provide an update here once the apprpopriate information has been gathered. Thank you!,"A basic reporting function that is embarrasingly ""missing""... please add asap!",When can we expect this to be made available?,This is very dissapointing.  There have been a lot things lately that we are finding Salesforce can not.  ,Great news!!,Only took 7 years :-),Has this been incorporated yet into SF?,Thx for working on this SF. Please keep in mind that people are also asking for a Goal Line as well as a trend line. Seeing the goal witht the bar chart is crucial.,None,Happy Monday Community members! Thank you for your feeback, votes and comments. This Idea has reached point threshold and our PM organization will be actively reviewing it as a potential feature. The team should be able to provide an update here once the apprpopriate information has been gathered. Thank you!,Wow surprised this options is not available for charting,hopefully the existence of wave analytics wont block this initiative,I would also love to see this type of calculation and trend analysis.,None,Necessary,Would love this. Currectly need to export to Excel to do this, so everything gets converted to Excel so it all looks uniform for reports.
Cut and Paste Images and Text into Knowledge Article,Tammy Pena,Product Team Review,3720,15,I agree with the suggestion.  Not every image can be described adequately in text.,desperately needed. Especially word files. Or at least the option to save word files as htm(l), and paste the html-coding into the body field.,We're building a new knowledge base and most articles will have images. If we can't copy & paste articles into our articles, you can imagine how much time will be lost. Please this would be very usefull for us and many others too i'm sure! ,None,For the first time, today, it appeared to me that cut/paste from word could work with pictures.  The pictures actually showed up (instead of just text, as I've seen in the past).  Sadly, upon saving, I received an error the two times I tried it.  The error brought me to this community.,This would be a huge help! We too have tons of articles to create with screen shots. ,So important!!!! Please enable the cut and paste!!!,We also have tons of documentation with screen shots and calculation tables.  I would hate to have to re-do all of it so it would be much easier if we could just cut/paste,Amazing, 3 years and this is still an issue. How was this overlooked? One thing I have done to work around this issue is to simply publish the article with the steps, and at the beginning simply say that there is a word document attached with the KBA contents and pictures. Better than nothing.,This would help with updating articles with new images in the future.,This would be fantastic. ,easy to create an article.,I think this would be a step towards making knowledge article creation more robust.,Not having this functionality is such a waste of time!  All of our articles (currently kept in word files) contain screen shots.  In order for me to even get started using articles I will have to save hundreds of screen shots.  ,Completely agree with this idea. My team are currently spending so much time in trying to recreate the documentation we have. Could be a real time saver
Need to log Event using Inbox,Barbara Beaudin,Under Point Threshold,110,3,We need this functionality in Outlook 2013, OWA and the iOS app.,None,Users of Salesforce Inbox would like to have this feature as it would make the experience more complete and enhance the overall utility of the app.
Live Agent: Allow automatic timeout for Agent availability status,Siew-Luan Seah,Under Point Threshold,530,8,None,None,Session logouts are an unacceptable solution as it impacts the entire organization.  My support agents need this automated; we need to take the human error out of it.  Also, as an admin, it is extremely troublesome to have to reload the 30+ windows I have up as I'm in the middle of implementing something due to session timeouts.,This is needed. I request to salesforce production team to look into this issue and suggest a sollution.,None,This is a must, I accidentally took a chat at 11pm last night. (I thought I logged out at 5, but apparently did not.) I really do not like taking chats at 11pm!!!,This is very important if implemented as a configuration option. This will allow our support representatives to be able to multi-task and work on a variety of things without having to remember one more thing to do. The smarter we can make the system, the better experience our customers will have. If our support rep forgets to set themselves as inactive our customers could be waiting for a transfer or waiting to initiate a chat for some time.  Our chat could also incorrectly show as available when it's not. This helps us serve our customers better with accurate information on which support agents are available.  ,This is needed!
Case Thread ID as field on Case Page Layout,Daniel Quisdorf,Under Point Threshold,2230,16,None,None,None,We have had the same conversation Ziemowit Kupracz. Can't we have a button? Our conversations ended with," the fact that it's so easy to triple click (yes I said ""Triple Click that is a thing",https: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-click) and then copy the field (CTRL-C)," it does not make sense to add ""bloat"" to Salesforce with a button. Native functionality of the formula field alone is all that's needed. So we have come to the conclusion that adding a button to replace a triple-click and copy", does not make it better, rather it's wasteful and sets a bad precedent for expectations with the users. ,"I think it would be even better if there was a button ""Copy to clipboardakin to""Click to call"" with telephone numbers. Most of the time (always?) it would be copied for external use anyway.",None,None,Definitely worth adding this as an out-of-the-box feature, which would provide permanent solution over this inturruptive custom formulas. And seems like the Ref Id feature, as a flexible easy-to-go with Email-2-Case from Outlook and other Email Clients, is being used as custom internal solution by multiple customers already.,Would be nice to reference this without a formula,None,None,None,This is crazy to me that SF knows the Thread ID and generates it any time an email from salesforce is created, but won't let you put it in a field. It's also crazy that a bad formula has survived in the latest comment from product management for 2 years.,None,None,None
Customize Printable View,Leo Correa Alves,Product Team Review,5310,15,I agree, need to have ability for more than one printable output. We want to output to PDF... printable view for sales people to included cerain sets of data, printable view for account reivew intended to share with a customer as a snapshot of their account, printable view to include charts (not just $$ charts but customizable for # of open cases at the account, types of cases at the account, etc) and also allow the printable view at the parent level to have the option of rolling up detail from child accounts or just reporting at the parent level. No updates on this idea in 10 years or did I miss an update somewhere? As a 10 year old idea, sounds great but hopefully something delivered accomodates what has changed for us users in the 10 years since the original.,This would be great with an export button to excel as well.  ,Would be very helpful for us.  We convert qualified leads before passing to our partners.  Some partners pass the printable view of the opportunity to their salespeople, which includes a lot of detail on opportunity and account fields, but lacks basic contact information, such as phone number & e-mail.  In theory, we could display these contact fields on the opportunity record (custom lookup fields), but that seems like a crazy work-around.,This is definitely needed by our group!  At least we need to get our company logo at the top of the page.  Any plans to get that going?,this is a must-have! ,bring print view back for records/contacts/and assets. need an easy way to export and give these to customers,Improves User experience!,None,We need the printable view to display only what we need to, rather than displaying all the data in master record and the related records.,Yes Please Add this, I would like to be able to do this on Cases as well.,We're seeing that cases with multiple in-line emails will repeat the string in the Case Printable View. It'd be nice if there was a feature to simply show (& print) one complete string of emails.  ,None,It would make life easier!  Please add. ,It would make life easier!  Please add. ,Great idea!
Customize Navigation Menu in Napili Template by Profile,Katie McFadden,Under Point Threshold,280,2,If there are Page variations based on Profiles, there should be Navigation menu that can be displayed based on Profile of the logged in Community user,Has anyone found a way to do this? I've tried using object/tab settings for profiles as well as permission sets but haven't found any of it to work yet.
Host visualforce on the same domain as the org,Andrew Kurland,Under Point Threshold,1250,13,we so need the native salesforce domains visual.force.com to be whitelisted ,We need it very much. No js - no modern app ;(,Please take care of this problem as soon as possible!,This is a huge issue now that javascript sidebar hacks will be unavailable when Summer 15 is released.  I can't undrestand why Salesforce would treat it's own visual.force.com as a separate untrusted domain.  It should automatically white listed.  With the new CORs, it still won't work.  We really  need this.  It's surprising to me that this issue has been open for so long without being addressed. ,Need sooner. if one can do with Scontrol why not with visual force page. As one of our  requirements was to hide some sections based on user profile accessing same layout. Can't do in the section page using javascript as hit by cross domain issue.Din't find any other solution using single layout how to hide some sections based on user  profile .,None,None,Either give us back our S-Controls or give us Visualforce pages that have at least as much functionality! Whatever happened to preserving backwards compatibility and a clean upgrade path?, Need more promotion for this idea.  This is a much bigger issue now that s-Controls are deprecated.  I just converted one of my s-Controls over to a VF page and had to code around cross site scripting issues that should not be an issue, resulting in inferior usability in my VF page compared to the original s-Control.,This problem is causing me to be unable to change the URL on the parent window from JavaScript on a modal dialog that is a VF page.  This definitely should change.  Guess I'll solve it with an S-control...but would prefer to be able to use VF.,"The Appexchange package ""Web Analytics"" has a S-control for Dashboard tracking", it needs info from the parent frame (using JavaScript) in order to work correctly.The same code on a Visualforce page does not work as JavaScript is not allowed to get information from a parent frame that is on another domain.,It seems s-controls are going to end very soon (probably the next release) which is great. But I think this is a big gap and needs to be addressed, any updates from salesforce?,"This has also caused problems when migrating from existing s-controls that call hidden URLs on salesforce.com. We've had to (again) use s-controls to fill gaps in the VF framework in this way.It also causes problems with setting security exclusions for""salesforce.com"" because VF is coming from ""force.com"". This seems like unnecessary complexity", and I haven't seen a good reason for it being done yet!
Line Item Sort for quote in Lightning,Erik Peterson,Under Point Threshold,1050,15,this needs to happen.,This is a must have," it should be common sense to have this feature already built into any software that creates quotes. Everything looks professional until the quote gets printed and the customer is like ""where is the base item?"" only to be found half way down the quote. Delivery and Promotions should be listed on the bottom like they are everywhere else.",I am a bit stunned at finding out I can't sort my products in Lightning like I can in Classic. It's vital for sales quotes.  After getting off the phone with support to confirm this limitation in Lightning, I submitted a request for research into some kind of work around.... wish me luck!,Very surprising to learn that this was not considered when Quoting was added to Lightning. Should be able to have custom sort order (and view more fields than simply Product Name when sorting).,Necessary,Yes!!!!! ,None,This is important and already works in the classic version,yes, plssss.... it's a must!,Must have feature ,Rediculous that this requires that we re-vote on this feature. It took forever to have it included in Salesforce Classic, now we must get 830 points for it to be considered? This should already be on the release plan Salesforce! There is a demostrated need for this feature!,None,a must!,Absolutely ridiculaous that this is not included. The Quote Lines don't enev seem to show up in the same order as the lines on a synced Opportunity.,This is a must have - not sure why it's not available in lightning as well.
Lightning Page Layout Click on Tiles to view them,Matthew Hauck (p),Under Point Threshold,10,0
Allow header to be customized in Napili Communities Template,James Loghry,Under Point Threshold,580,13,None,This might help :- https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/components_config_for_builder_theme_layout.htm,Agree. Need flexibility to change logo size,None,This is essential for PKB (Public Knowledge Base) only communites where the community is a public site only and there will never be a login. I have modified the CSS to remove the community login section and a few other sections from being visible on my PKB stie. ,Totally agree!  We should have the flexibility to customize the header section without recreating everything.,Great feedback James, and under heavy consideration for upcoming releases (Safe Harbor).  I may reach out to you as we're designing and developing to solicit more input.   Stay tuned.,None,Thanks for posting this idea.  We would also like to have the individual components (search, profile, logo) available for placement elsewhere on the community template.  The header can now be hidden, but if you hide it, all that functionality is lost.,Th,Th,It would be nice if those widgets were either available for a custom header, or you could at least turn off the ones you don't want individually.,Fully agree, we need to allow more customization and share the components code.
Make Activity Comments a Text Area (Rich) Field,Michael Brosseau,Under Point Threshold,1580,15,None,This is needed desparetely as multiple clients are demanding about this feature on task. Please please please allow this. ,None,I must say that I am disappointed there is no markup language for the comments field. I would love to be able to format text and add more attractive looking hyperlinks. ,Adding a Rich Field to Tasks can be very useful.Actually, our users are limited to 255 char to write a comment on tasks.This is very limiting!!,Rich Text features for adding worklogs or notes to cases is critical for support organizations that work on highly technical issues. Work logs will often include multiple log lines or long working logs that can be very dense. Being able to bold or highlight specific lines to call things out for people reading those notes later is extremely valuable.,We are trying to move away from a custom worklog object and having this functionality as standard functionality is vital,Makes no sense at current stage of web apps capabilities not to have this feature. Add it please,This is a popular request by our Sales team to maintain Rich Text Area in Activities. This is a popular request and should be on your todo list please.,Must have feature,I wish this were already implemented, trying to implement a workaround is actually quite complex.,This would be fantastic! I'm hesitant to let my users use 'Notes' as this would spread data out between tasks/activities and notes, whereas ideally it would all be together. But Notes has rich text enabled which is a huge benefit! Making the comment field in tasks/activities should be an easy fix and would make a huge difference.,Yes, having rich text in activity comments would be a great help for the users.,This is quite useful for Support Agents who need to take notes about their call and read them later.,It is great to have new features now and then but it is also very important to get the small highly used things right as well. And this is one of them.
Delete processing of roles by execution from SOAP_API,茂博 清水,Under Point Threshold,30,0
Mass transfer tasks,Donna Holbrook,Under Point Threshold,1800,15,This is needed for when people are away/sick at our org.,This should be an OTB feature.,We have a similar issue we often will move Task between Users eiethr on a temprary or permanent basis, with multiple brands using the same Org simply re-assigning the Account does not work.,This is certainly needed, the Activity view should have the same functionality as other views, enabling the user to select their tasks and transfer them to another owner.,Please add,Please add,Yes - no uncommon for people to leave a company and therefore a need to transfer tasks. ,Needed, please add.,None,None,Great idea,great idea,Should absolutely be implemented!... upvote away!,yes please!!,Ideally the transfer of activities for ALL objects would work like Opportunities - with the OPTION of transferring them or not.
Public groups for Profiles,Krishna Prasad Kizhakke Palamangalam,Under Point Threshold,380,8,Run across a use case where it is needed. Have to work around it.,Why are there only 27 votes for this? Really need this functionality!,How is this not available? I'm looking at contracting out for a trigger for this functionality, since I'm getting mixed DML errors using Process Builder (based on the other automation that we need).,This would be really handy..,I think it will be very useful if salesforce implements this.We will be able to create reports for a certain profile and make group of similar profiles.,I need this for my Organization as well. ,In our case we have multiple profiles for partner users and need to give access to certain dashboards based on profile.,This would make life so much easier, and in many different circumstances. We have different cases where users all share the same role, but have different profiles. If we could add them to groups, report folders etc. at the profile level rather than just roles (or roles & subs), it would make access management much easier.
Scheduled actions from Process Builder should appear under Time-Based Workflow,Chris Edwards,Product Team Review,7410,16,None,Jennifer Sacks, Thanks for pointing the group in the direction of where they can find the records for the time based actions. ,None,What we have now is really of no use.,None,Wow, the current user experience is certainly not ideal.  I just created a rather complicated PB with time-based actions, and now I'm very sorry I did, because I'm unable to test it properly.,Just needed this feature. Please merge monitoring functionality of time-based workflows & processes.,The workaround doesn't work. We don't have detail about the record. How can we delete a time-based process builder flow without knowing for which record it's related? Very annoying.,Really? You want the community to justify this?,None,Great idea.  The details that time-based workflows provide is much better than the paused and waiting interviews does.  ,None,None,The current functionality is lacking compared to what Time-Based Worflow offers.  To workout which record will be trigged, when and be able to mange more efficiently is a must.,None,This is definitely needed for testing.
Extend max limit of 50 criteria-based sharing rules,Christopher Bruzzi,Under Point Threshold,1570,15,Just hit the limit of 50. ,Need this.,We will eventually need 50 - 100 criteria based sharing rules,There is a definite need for limit increase,For global organisation, 50 is very less. Please increase the limit,50 = bad,@Adam Grossman, unfortunately, this is only for all sharing rules (criteria and owner-based), but as far as I'm aware, the limit of criteria-based sharing rules itself is not increased,There are business scenarios where you need to acheive the Criteria based sharing rules, ideally this limit needs to be completed removed.,300 sharing rules is plenty for my org, but the limit of 50 being criteria based is too small.,None,Yes, need this please.,An increase in the limit is necessary to allow for team-based sharing based on custom objects using public groups.,I just hit the limit on criteria based sharing rules right and would love if the limit was removed completely! ,About to run in the same limitation - please increase it! ,I would love to see that incresed, it definitely makes sense to achive many business cases through criteria based sharing rules which we are achieving presently using apex managed sharing.
Email Templates with Custom From & Reply Fields,Jason Atwood,Under Consideration,8300,16,None,Last update a year ago under consideration - please - and there are other ideas with similar requests - if someone has the time to collate and merge them all!!,I just encountered this limitation.  It would be extremely helpful to our business if this was available.,Is this feature on your roadmap?,Must Have,Good Idea!!!,None,None,None,This would help automate our email to case  process - I vote yes - long overdue ,In addition, It would be great if we can extend this to the Org Wide emails too. This could potentially save good amount of resources in SFDC/Customer sites from emails generated via email loops.,None,None,None,Org wide addresses are useful, but in this instance we really want this to look like the email came from the sales rep rather than a generic group email. Setting up separate org wide address and separate workflows for each of the reps for each of the possible scenarios is not a good work around.,"You can use the ""org-wide email addresses"" when sending emails with Templates", that will set the from address to a verified address the user has access to and can select. Would that work in your use case?
Edit Mode: optimize field sizes to look less clumsy,ErikM,Under Point Threshold,1890,15,We definitely need this enhacement.,Definitely needed. This is one of the first issues that our users have picked up.,None,This is still not a thing?,This should apply to free text fields also - Account Name for example. There's plenty of room for this field to be 3x wider!,Inferior standard field behavior for 9 years? Really? Isn't this an easy fix to allow adjustable custom text fields? Regardless of vote counts, this one should be addressed.,Inferior standard field behavior for 9 years? Really? Isn't this an easy fix to allow adjustable custom text fields? Regardless of vote counts, this one should be addressed.,It would be really helpful having customizing option to the text field sizes.,It would make editing a form much easier if we could edit the column width in 2 column sections, where 1 column needs much less space on the page than the other.,A totally unsupported workaround for your own use or someone you trust with it who knows HTML / CSS, you can use a plugin like Stylish for Firefox to edit the CSS on the client side and adjust the width.  You'll need to find the unique id name of the input field or combination of classes to adjust the item(s) you want. If turned on, Stylish automatically loads the CSS modifications anytime you load the site.,None,Auto-adjust to field width please,+1,None,"It would be great to have a ""Snap to Left / Right"" feature in page layouts so that field labels can be aligned. We have a new page layout on a custom object with two LTA fields at the bottom of the page and the page looks very disjointed. And I see using Visualforce as a workaround", not a solution (clicks not code!).

Ability to Assign Tasks in Lightning to Multiple Users,John Havelka,Under Point Threshold,1710,15,+1,This is literally a deal breaker for the lightening transition for my team.,None,Not having such feature, makes our team less efficient,How can this not be available in Lightning?  Please fix ASAP so we can continue to use Lightning.,Please, add this functionality ASAP, has no sense to have just 1 to 1 meetigns available. This make the event functionality un-usefull in many scenarios.,Should be available in LIghtning!,We need this functionality in lightning in order to migrate!,This ability would be a HUGE time saver for our team!,it's mandatory for all user like it works in classic,Please fix it in the lightning version.,Please add this enhancement to Lightning ASAP!,Would like to see this enhancement in place.,Yes, Please add this feature,This feature is a must have. 
Too much white space in Lightning UI,Josh Hendrix,Product Team Review,3730,15,@Lee Moreau, could you show us what you mean? Would you care uploading an image of a dummy company?,None,Excessive white space is a dealbreaker for me. I've had many clients in the past insist on using older versions of software because of it. Please change this natively so that we don't need to do custom development just to be able to see as much data on a single screen as we used to. We need to see more, actually: Salesforce Classic has always been much less efficient with screen space than other CRM platforms. Thank you!,Can we add the option to add color contrast to the white space,@Lee, sure it looks modern with its clean interface, but the goal of software UX design is designing products that are useful, easy to use, and delightful to interact with. It's when you start to use it that it gets annoying.,I think you just have to get used to it.  I didn't like it at first," but then all the new grads in their 20s in my office were all like THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!!  What I can't stand is the daily ""Sorry to interrupt!"" error message that forces me to reboot my computer before it works.  I get it all the time", so frustrating.  Everything working perfecly fine then that pops up, then doesn't matter what you click on or where you go, log out log back in," constant ""Sorry to interrupt!  Explain to us what you were doing to cause this error to help our technical teams out.""  Just did it as I was writing this reponse", does it to all my users and only a reboot fixes it.,The huge amount of unused white space on the screen is a big reason none of my clients have moved from classic to LEX.  I keep trying to like LEX but until it is possible to put more data on the screen as is done in classic, I just can't recommend it.,Completely agree, acres of white space makes the layout unnecessarily difficult to read, especially given the decision was taken to use a colour palette with very little contrast......,None,None,So happy I'm not the only one to think this!  I keep trying to force myself to use Lightning and then after about 5 minutes I immediately go back.  At first the speed of Lightning killed me as it's much slower than Classic, but use it for a bit and you get used to it.  But what drives me crazy is how big the fonts are and all the white space.  That's what I love about Classic, I can see SO much on my screen at the same time without having to scroll.  In Lightning everything is so big and inefficient, I feel like I'm using Salesforce for the visually impared or something.  Smaller fonts and less white space would be so much better.  (That and the ability to see more than 4 columns at once on a related list, as that's the #1 reason we aren't swtching to Lightning).,Hi, I really want Lightning to be a real step forward for our business. However the acres of white space make it look like a backward step for many users.,YES!!!  What Sheryl said.,I'd love to be able to split the Details page into different tabs, much like one can do with Related Lists vs. Related List.  I wouldn't mind the whitespace so much if I could let users tab to different areas of the record details instead of having to scroll and/or collapse sections repeatedly.,I agree, this excessive whitespace is very counterproductive. Also, when you edit in the lightning UI the fields don't stay in the same place.
Ability to set 'Fewer Update'  as the default option,Alex Wu,Partial Delivery in Winter '16,4850,16,Hi Everyone - good news is we have some ehancements in the pipeline (winter '16 safeharbor) that should address some of the painpoints around this need. I'll post an update once I have more on the specifics to share. ,It appears that you Can select to show Fewer Updates now and still keep Chatter Publisher Actions visibile however, by selecting Show Fewer, it only removes the last 11 Chatter posts and it isn't a permenant setting.  Meaning when the page refreshes, the 11 Fewer are back.   Not exactly partial.   I'd say negligible, nil...,What was the partial delivery?,To increase chatter adoption in our org, we REALLY need the ability to have it default to 'Fewer Updates'. ,Our org uses Chatter Publisher Actions religiously however, the inability to show fewer updates by default Greatly diminishes the benefit.  ,Really need an answer to this.,None,None,None,None,None,Jeez - PLEASE can you organise some development on this?!  It is a daily, if not hourly, paibn point for many SFDC users that could be so easily done.  Why no feedback from ANYONE at Salesforce??,None,Please do it already!,Doing an initial roll out of chatter in our org and the white noise in chatter groups is a pain point. I would love to have this option as a default as well.,@Kristie Garafola, any updates for us please?
State & Country Picklists - Accept ISO 3 Code values and compliant Text updates,Matthew Lamb,Under Point Threshold,950,15,Agreed,Agree,To make use of the country code effectively, ISO APHA 3 codes and ISO Numberic 3 codes should be allowed to use via the OOTB functioanlity which reduces lot of custom code or logic. Thanks for taking it up. ,Our company has standardized on three character country codes.  Please make option possilble?,Our company has standardized on character country codes.  Please make option possilble?,I'm not sure I agree with this Idea -- if you can enter US, USA, or United States into BillingCountryCode," then what value gets returned in a subsequent SOQL query/data loader export? 'US"" or whatever you entered?  This would seem to only create more confusion.",Agree,You can create new codes, up to 10 characters. But creating a whole new set of 239 ISO 3 Country Codes is not a good option. How about allowing ISO Codes to be edited before State and Country Picklist are initially enabled. Or allow the Administrator to choose whether they want to use 2 or 3 character ISO codes during initial setup.,I agree. Please make this available as soon as possible. ,Great idea!  This simplifies integrating Salesforce with other 3rd party systems using 3 digit ISO codes.,Please provide ability to add/process 2 digit and 3 digit ISO codes,This would be very helpful since ISO-3166 includes both 2 and 3 character values.,Agreed.  Please consider this enhancement.,None,This is really important.  For example, for Mexico:  Our users in Mexico say that NOBODY uses the 2-character ISO state codes for Mexico. They all use the 3-character versions.  That's what they'll enter in external systems that will integrate into SFDC.

Cannot remove/edit Namespace prefix, once defined for Managed Apps,Sanjeev Mehta,Under Point Threshold,1970,16,None,Must Needed.,Needed sorely :(,Hope it will come soon.,This feature would be really helpful.,We require this functionality as well.  Share and upvote!,Sorry, Please give the option to remove name space prefix so that it will be useful while completing challanges in trailhead.,Please give the options to remove trailhead so that it will be useful while completing challanges in trailhead.,There should also be a way to remove the namespace from the developer edition, because many times developer include the namespace for testing purpose, but then want to remove it. It would really help, if we can have this feature at least for developer edition orgs. ,None,Dev. org facing issues after defining the namespace. I know that it is used for a uniquely referencing in SFDC cloud for managed pkg environment.But removal/updation should be processed via salesforce case.,Like so of the others on this list, I completely messed up my Developer org with this namespace. Now I'll have to try and get a new one.,How we can handle namespace referenced code in another dev org?,This should be implemented ASAP,Once silly little nit is that the prefixes are occasionally case-senstive, and once you define an prefix like MixedCaps you can't change it to MIXEDCAPS or mixedcaps, for consistency with other packages you might maintain. ,At least allow us to rename it!
Show Marketing Cloud Subscriber Status in a Salesforce Contact Field,Peter Dunau,Under Point Threshold,30,1,The subscriber status should also be easily reportable/exportable from the Marketing Cloud.
Make Sales Path available as a component for Change Set configuration,James Howard,Under Point Threshold,1050,9,We are also on the way to use path for custom objects and would love to have path as component for our change sets.,With Path becoming even more widely available for custom objects now, it is needed with change sets for proper management from sandbox to production environments. ,Sería de mucha utilidad contar con esta funcionalidad, sobretodo para clientes donde tienen muchos tipos de registro y para cada tipo de registros requieren una ruta de ventas.,This is even more crucial with the introduction of Paths in Winter 17 (which is great BTW).,i've looking for this feature... i can't find it yet... some one knows how could we deploy a Sales Path easier?,Is this available yet?,This would be helpful in adding efficiency and reducing errors.,How could this have been left out? ,Really needs to be there.

Salesforce1 Should Show All List Views in the Salesforce1 App,Peter Theodore,Partial Delivery in Spring '15,5800,16,None,"This is one of the biggest limitations of the Salesforce1 Mobile App. And showing list views that a user has already used in a desktop application would not be a good solution. If Salesforce is meant to be a ""mobile first"" or even ""mobile friendly"" product then the user experience must reflect this. Glaring usability bugs like this frustrate users", undermine adoption of our implementations and also undermine the Salesforce brand name. ,This is still not delivered for Salesforce1 app and is the biggest struggle our mobile first field team has with adoption. ,"It is really indispensable!!!!!!!!! Salesforce has some ""weak points"" that we can not understand. ",Can someone identify the metadata that needs to be updated/triggered in order for a View to be shown on the mobile app?  Couldn't APEX code be run against the Views that you want all users to see so that you don't have to physically log in as each user and access the given View on the web version, in order to have it show up on the mobile app (ie. what field values on the backend trigger the View to appear in the mobile app)?    ,None,None,This is very important for our team.,this is very cumbersome design for salesforce 1 downloable app as I have to go to these sales users' desktop and click on list views one by one in order for them to show on the phone.,This is very important for our sales force teams. Please implement asap,This is a must have for our sales team. Let's go from partial delivery to full delivery please. ,Users should have the flexibility to pull up the list views rather than adding filters on the fly.,We are instructing our users to click on their most common List Views on Desktop which will populate on Salesforce1 - not ideal, but works as an interim solution. ,Has anybody found a work-around for this?

Lock records for editing,Travis Bryant,Product Team Review,4290,16,None,"If you have used websites like ""Booking.com"" to book a hotel", it tells how many users are also viewing the same hotel to give you an indication of the people interested in the same record. When a record record is clicked, can we not track who opened the record (THIS FEATURE IS NOT CURRENTLY IN SALESFORCE) and maintain this statistics. Same can be applied when a record is opened for editing and locked for a specified period of time other than the current user. ,None,None,Locking the record or at least giving a visual warning that someone else is accessing the record should be a standard feature, it is in Zendesk.  This is the issue I am asked most about and causes a lot of concern for our customer support team.,None,Just had a conversation about this with our Customer Care team.  Zendesk is a threat to Salesforce, but apparently Salesforce doesn't see it that way, please pay attention!   Our CCare director complains she'd prefer Zendesk every time I see her, this kind of issue (that according to others in this feed) has been addressed does not help us as Salesforce.com Evangelists.  Please find a fix in the next release!  10 years is plenty of time to wait....thanks.,None,None,We have problems with this on a daily basis and are amazed that there is no solution available. Please update as soon as possible.,We have just moved over from Zendesk where this is a standard feature, absolutely bizarre that its not the same on something as big as Salesforce! ,We are definitely running in to this with Customers, for example, who are migrating from Desk.com to Service Cloud.  Desk.com already has Collision Prevention and the migrating Teams expect the same in Salesforce.,Jennifer - thanks for the update.  Another important piece to consider is when integrated systems (like Marketo) update records.  We've learned when Marketo is READING a new change, they still lock the record, and so these contention errors have been coming up on our users frequently.  This is further exacerbated because we frequently need to do sequential edits (i.e., save a change to the parent account which triggers some behaviors before we make other edits to the contact fields).  Marketo sees the first edit and feels the need to [lock the record] to read, then our user's second edit is blocked because Marketo has locked the record.  They have to re-enter their second set of edits after refreshing the page.  It slows down our users, is frustrating, and is hindering adoption and Salesforce reputation.  Is there some way to avoid this locking of records for reading?  And as David asked, would you please expand on the auto-merge non-conflicting edits?  We aren't seeing that either.  We just see a complete block.,None,None,Properly handling of dual editing is a MUST feature for a cloud shared app!   
Let me modify Tab visibility from the Tab Settings,Amber Boaz,Product Team Review,5760,16,User and Permission Management in Lightning Setup is in early design stages.  This idea will be incorporated into the reimagined experience.,@Belinda Wong, we're hoping to have the ability to mass hide/show existing tabs in classic, not lightning. Is the product team reviewing this idea for classic too?,Wow! 7 years and this basic feature request is not implemented? Come on Salesforce!!,@belinda Wong, It would be great if this wasn't only designed for the lightning experience, not all of us have abandoned the core platform and made the switch to lightning. Especially due to the performance issues and lack of features in lightning. ,User and Permission Management in Lightning Setup is in early design stages.  This idea will be incorporated into the reimagined experience.,You call deleting and recreating tabs a workaround?  How do you suppose I handle hiding of 50+ installed package tabs?,None,None,120 manual profile updates to hide ONE tab that was part of a managed package... unacceptable!   I wish I could vote for this idea a million times! If we had a data loader workaround that would be one thing, but this is a completely manual process.  ,Ran into the same issue, security link needs to be on Tabs too just like for example we have on Visual Force Pages,It would be nice if it's enabled,This really sucks when you have a managed package and can't even delete the VF Tab and re-create it!  We have over 200 profiles!,Editing the tab settings on each profile is too time consuming!,This would be a great feature and save us so much time. Please add!,We have 200 profiles and it is pain to edit each profile just to make tab default on/tab tidden.,A must for admins.
Clone standard report types,Scott McCambridge,Under Point Threshold,770,15,None,This seems such an obvious time-saver.,This will really help because our users often times want to create a standard report, and merge multiple objects together.  I.E. Cases, Opportunities, contacts and accounts.  Thank you for you consideration! ,Reaaly folks, let's get this to the prod.,We really need this capability. What can we do to promote more upvotes? Perhaps a Facebook page, for Salesforce ideas?,Yes please!,This will be really great to have!,This is needed badly!,Yep, surprised this still isn't available.  Creating a whole new custom report type that essentially replicates a standard one only because I need to include some other fields (via lookup) is really a drag...,This sure would be a time-saver. Surpirsed it has been around 5 years and doesn't have more votes.,This would be very helpful. There are some standard report types that a user can't replicate and there are times when I would really like to be able to add a few additional fields from related objects to a standard report type.,We could really use this when our users need modifications to the standard reports, which we can't recreate via Custom Reports. Example = Cases with Assets,I am suprised this idea doesn't have more votes. It would be really helpful to be able to clone a standard report type, as a jumping board for creating one's own custom report. It would be a huge time saver as others have mentioned. ,Would love to be able to start with a standard profile and adjust to what is needed.,We need to be able to Clone Standard report types, this feature will save a lot of time for our customers.
Markdown Support,J.P. Poveda,Under Point Threshold,750,15,Markdown for Case email replies!,None,This would be helpful feature.,I can even format my comment here which goes to show how commonplace this functionality is.,This is pretty common functionality everywhere - it needs to be included,None,None,Readability is one the of the most important things for me to be able to communicate to my customers.,+1! I was thinking about going with a VF approach, but if there were native support, I'd be all over it.,None,None,None,None,None,Displaying markdown documents in the Content Preview window would be nice too!
Update product price automatically in Multi Currency,Saar Machtinger,Under Point Threshold,260,7,This is a must have and hardly required for every org that works with multi currency on products,None,None,I agree, this should be a must. I do not see why Salesforce have included the exchange rates in settings but failed to enable this feature when generating product/price book pricing. Or simply allow to opportunities to converter a quote to different currencies based on the entered exchange rates. I now have the massive job to update 3 price books on over 2k products due to the recent exchange rate changes. ,Are we just supposed to load pricebook updates every time the currency gets updated?  I'm not sure what is out there to fill this gap if we have this use case?  Seems like an administrative nightmare.,I'm in the same boat.  Finance would like us to have our currenct rates updated from a feed, but that is implausible because we have to manually update our 2000 prices (in two currencies) every time the rate is changed.,None
Chatter Email Digest timing,Charles Stevenson,Partial Delivery in Summer 16,2920,16,None,None,We are a global company and it would be extremely helpful to allow our Users to be able to select when they would like to receive these emails based on their time zone.  This would be extremely helpful for our Partner Community, we have had complaints from Partners regarding the time that the Digests arrive in their inbox.,None,None,Is the Chatter Digest emails dependent of time zone?  I'm getting these emails at midnight, but If I can't change the time I recieve this, can I change my time zone 12 hours ahead so I can get these at lunch instead? Can't believe this still hasn't been addressed.,Can this please be considered priority? There is an obvious need for it, apparently there was going to be a fix over a year ago. @Bobby White any changes to your initial coment?,Please give us an easy way to change the timing.,None,I'd really like to keep recieving the digest, but not in the middle of the night.  I intentionally don't silence my phone, but would have to if there's no way to change the timing of the digest, or I'd have to opt out of recieving the digest.  ,We are new to salesforce but my staff memeber just said that he was woken up by an alery at 12:30 am with the daily digest. It does really seem silly for a software this big not to have time settings for daily automatic emails. ,None,Agree with all the comments.  Easy fix should be to set once for an org under Chatter Settings and would suit ours and seemingly most people's needs.  A more involved option would be, in addition to changing the org wide setting, to allow users to set their own.  This would suit orgs with users in various time zones.  But I think we'd rather get a quick option #1 than a wait for option #2.  Thanks!,I agree with all of these comments. I have to wake up midnight!,Please come quickly.,Having my phone alert me to a new email every night at 12:30am is extremely bothersome - this should be an really easy adjustment to make. 
Different Field Names, Based on Record Type,Zach Lawryk,Product Team Review,6020,16,Ability to change the help text along with field label will be very valuable.,For orgs using Customer / Partner Communities this would be particularly useful.,This is a very Valuable feature which would improve the reusability of the fields and reduces the complexity in customization. ,We support over 15 business units and need this feature to assist with streamlining processes and creating an enhanced user experience.,We have 20 business units in our Salesforce org and we heavily rely on record types. If this feature is delivered then we will be able to eliminate the need for us to use a lot of custom objects. ,Ability to change the help text along with field label will be very valuable.,very valuable,Very useful feature to have,very usefull information,yeap need it asap,This is a much needed feature to create different field for each record type for same functionality.,Common issue for us in opportunity object, that stage field is used very often but some small teams would like to use different name and we cannot remove it from layout as well because it is connected to forecasting! ,Very useful feature!,None,None,None
Ability to Set Accounts & Contacts as Inactive,Don Kelly,Under Consideration,35490,16,None,None,It will be awesome to have lead archiving facility also.,None,None,When will this be happening?,None,@javeir, your process sounds logical. i think i can mange #1 and 2, but need help with #3 and 4. Is there a tutorial anywhere on how to do those last steps? very much appreciate any guidance. thank you!!,This should be standard on all versions of Salesforce. Deleting account/contact information is not a good idea. We had to create a custom field in our marketing automation solution to pull only active accounts to campaign to.,So as a relatively new SF user, I am continually shocked at the lack of such basic features.  Nearly EVERY CRM I've ever used had this feature, come one SF get with it!,None,None,Any progress on how this is progressing?,Can this really be true? Nine years in the pipeline for a basic feature?,Having recently moved to Salesforce, I am very surprised that making a contact inactive is not a part of the standard product.,None
Expose logging from a Beta managed package in the deployed org,Daniel Ballinger,Under Point Threshold,860,15,This is vital, the beta is the first step in your managed package, why would this not be there?,This is an important feature.,This is important feature to check before installing app on client.,useful feature,None,None,I'm actually surprised this isn't a thing. For Christ's sake, we are in the middle of 2015 and this isn't available for such important tasks as deploying an app to a client's organization. Everyone could benefit from this.,None,What else is there to say that hasn't already been said, please add it.,No idea why this is not available! Very necessary during beta phase.,None,please add it ! very hard to find the bugs if it's not exposed,Beta packages are very hard to debug without this.,This is often the time when these logs are needed most.,None

Ability to run Process on delete of Record - Process Builder,Yogesh Arora,Under Point Threshold,50,0
Allow deletion of state and country in 'State and Country Picklist',Anterey Custodio,Under Point Threshold,40,1,None
HTML Email Status in Lightning,Patrick Johnson,Under Point Threshold,20,0
Arial Unicode MS - Bold in PDF,Žiga Makuc,Under Point Threshold,210,4,None,None,Need this to show some bold text on PDF which supports multi language characters. ,I totally agree, I have the same problem and I have to use third party api for generating PDF. It is sad that Salesforce still can't do this.
Ability to join a parent object with the process instance object in report type,Hunhee Jang,Under Point Threshold,2300,15,None,This report is essential to manage the credit approval process,Agreed - need to be able to join these for reporting purposes.,Must needed. Also ability to convert elapsed days, elapsed hours, elapsed minutes fields on Process Instance node to business hours. Ability to exclude holidays from those fields.,THIS IS A MUST HAVE FEATURE. Please implement ASAP.,please implement this feature, this is super needed by our customer. ,This would increase my productivity and effeciency and reduce my time going into each opportunity with approval to get the Salesforce id to then run another report to Vlookup in data. There has to be a way to combine the process instance with the parent record type.,This is the feature Business users are wanting to report on the status of th approvals.,None,The current report type is more of a monitoring feature than a report. It would be nice to create a report type that has process instance as a primary object and the ability to relate all objects that has approval processes implemented. That way, it doesn't have to go through a joined report. It'll be more helpful to show all fields of an object and then grouped by approval steps.,Please add this feature.,Needed this feature, please add :),Good idea, hoping action would be taken on this.,We should have this.,this is a must have feature. 
Report Filter: ONLY the most recent Activity for each Parent Record,Melissa Newman,Product Team Review,5380,15,Definitely been needing this functionality since I started using Salesforce. Pretty please? ,Would be nice to not have to do extra fields and WFR / code to solve an easy reporting issue...please implement. ,None,This is a necessity in almost all reports. Awaiting eagerly!,High time, need this now,+1,None,None,It sure would be nice to be able to run a report in Salesforce and not have to export it into excel to get the data we're looking for.,Next time I contact support and they tell me I should add something to the IdeaExchange I'm going to reference this EXACT idea. 9 YEARS, reallY? Clearly there is a need here.....,When will you guys review this?!!,+1,Yet another frustration with SFDC reporting... Simple stuff made difficult ,Please make this a standard function in the Reporting tool. ,Faced with this now...lack of functionality makes it impossible, or at least extremely inefficient to view results of calling efforts.  Shocking that this is lacking in a solution that is geared towards sales.
Manage access and sharing rules on 'Unfiled Public Reports',Laurent LEMAZURIER,Product Team Review,2850,15,Agreed.  And in the case where we have a Community and some 3rd party contractors with access to our org, I don't even want some of them seeing the names of some of these reports.  If we cannot hide that folder from these users, there is an open security risk in using Salesforce reporting.,all the reports in Unfiled Public Reports Folder are able to search out by the portal user. it is bad, it display one client's reports to another client..I was able to see all reports in this folder when logged in as a portal user use the search report.  How can I limit this search in the community?,Hi, this will be very usefu for us. Need control over access to Unified public reports,We are facing the same issue too. Need to control access to Unfiled Public Reports.,I can't believe this even needs to be voted on... what a glaring oversight and should be considered a BUG.,"This would be great. We have already un-selected ""Manage Reports in Public Folders"" for a specific profile but these users can still create and save new reports in the Unified Public Reports Folder.",Definitely a good feature to avoid users creating reports for the entire ORG!,This will be a good feature or SFDC should allow creating sub-Folder under  'Unfiled Public Reports'.,None,This is critical for us because these 'Unfiled Public Reports' are being displayed in our Partner Portal. Even something as simple as Access = true or false, would be a huge help with this. ,Should be able to set the default folder to a personal rather than this public dumping ground; just as we are able to restrict creating of public views.,"Just turned on communities and realized this security hole. Need the ability to hide or control access to this folder. Understand its ""publicbut in some orgs the flow of data from internal to external needs strict monitoring and prior authorization.Please ? ",Certainly would help out our situation as well:),Yes it is definitely needed,Definitely an issue and admin overhead
"Flow -  ""List"" field type Screen element to display results for a Record Lookup.",Ian Carswell,Under Point Threshold,210,3,this is needed massively,Facilitating the creation of lists of records on a Flow Screen element would be nice.,This would be a huge help.
User Related Lists,Drew Alexander,Product Team Review,4880,16,Thanks for the idea and the great comments. Since a user could technically own 1000's of records, dashboards, etc... is a related list the right place for this? Lets say we had this, what would you use it for? Just to get a 'quick' run down of what's tied to the user or to remove the user from workflows/records, etc...? What would you do with this information?,As others have clearly mentioned, I'm here after creating a custom object and finding out I can't reference a list of them from the user page (or any custom visualforce page trying to leverage that child relationship),I just tried to add a related list for a custom object (training event) with a lookup to User. I was surprised this isn't an option, since every other object allows this.,This is a solid idea but, from my perspective, would need to come with the standard ability to remove certain related lists.  As Adam mentioned in the SFDC comment, Accounts and Contact listing would provide limited value.  However, the ability to quickly see other objects, including custom objects, would be of significant benefit.  Thanks for the consideration.,We have a custom User Field History object. We'd like to be able to create a stronger relationship between it and the standard User object so that we can access more information from each in reports and formulas.,The functionality for both User Record Related lists - as well as lookups from the User record would be a great compliment to our system needs.,We have a couple custom objects to keep track of all the equipment assigned to an employee as well as all the non-salesforce system access.  It would be nice ot be able to see the equpment and systems access assigned to a user on their user profile instead of having to run a report to find out this information.,No new updates from Salesforce in the last 4 years!?  As an admin, this functionality is definitely needed!  Let's make this happen!,Given that in lightning it does not appear from resarching that we will be able to use the badge element of work.com in lightning (apparently no plans to support in lightning) then we are having to reconsider ways to administer badges. We could do of a process but need somewhere to house the badge. In work.com it adds to chatter as a nice badge so was thinking it might be possible but not as pretty to do as a related list under the user. This idea would be a life saver given the investment we have put into badges.......PLEASE LET US KNOW IF ITS HAPPENING,This would be helpful when deactivating users. My manager asked me what the user was all tied to and I didn't have a clear cut response. Right now I'm reviewing in Sandbox in a remove one and then see what's next routine.,We have countries assigned to Users so that inbound leads are auto assigned. Each User should have the related list to see the list of countries. Those countries are a custom object as they include a lot of intelligence information in relation to the countries. So a PickList is not enough.,None,What I'd really like to see here, is a way that we can add a related list so that I can track SOX access approvals. I think that a related list on the user object would be the best way to go. At the moment, I'm tracking this in a very haphazard way! (Via the task object, and a set of data fields on the user record to relate to the most recent SOX review) I'd be fine with these being archived in the same way that tasks and activities are automatically archived to prevent the huge list of related records. Theoretically though, in my use case - there would only be 3 records per year.,Again this week," an executive said to me ""Type in Joe's name and show me everything he's working on"" - meaning where his name is attached opportunities", accounts," and contacts in particular. I had to say ""not that easy"," have to run several reports."" He looked over his glasses at me and said ""Really?"" in a tone that implied I was pretty useless as the owner of Salesforce at our (very large) company. It's a pretty reasonable question for him to ask. If he said ""show me everything related to the Exxon account"" I could do that (all opportunities", contacts, internal team, partners, competitors, plus some custom things like customer stories). So we can get a 360-degree view of our Accounts but not our own people.,This limits our use with Remedyforce and is a must have.,None
Configurable logo image in printable view,Spoon,Under Consideration,3830,16,None,None,Just came up today.  Could really use a fix here.,We are paying for a service that it supposed to give us the capability and customize ourselves to our clients regardless of the industry.  I am a health insurance broker and have created the Contact page to show payroll deductions for new hires.  I do not want to have an Employee sign/confirming w/ Salesforce Logo and NOT my logo.  I have had the Salesforce logo hidden, which is possible.  Then as an extra step I add my own using Adobe DC editor and add image.  But if I have multiple of these in a day or as I grow that is entirely to much time!!!  This needs to be fixed.,It is frustrating that we pay for the priveledge of promoting our vendor and not our Company.,incrediable,Yes. If the REAL reason it is because they (Salesforce) don't want it, at least they could say it! Ignoring this issue is annoying!,Exactly @Eddie Prignano. I dont get how they keep ignoring us on this issue. Its very frustrating to say the least.,WTF,Hi, any update on this please?,None,Anyhing new on this issue? Really would like this issues solved.,Agreed.,None,None,None
Remove storage.pardot.com in LinkedIn posts,Maurizio Pittau,Under Point Threshold,60,0
Email Template: 'Last Used Date' & 'Times Used',Rheena Buenaflor,Under Point Threshold,1740,15,None,Disappointed this isn't a standard feature. ,Please update fields.,Very useful to have this field updated in all scenarios whenever EmailTemplate is used.,I always wondered why these fields would remain blank. This should seriously be corrected to included all uses of the email templates!,The Last Used Date and Times Used need to also include automated processes and workflows. Workflows are a much larger consumer of email templates than individual user actions. ,Agreed this is currenly useless information.,Basically, these are useless fields unless they get populated with workflow/flow/process builder hits.,None,Adding to point threshold as most organizations could benefit from this enhancement,This is required as the template is being used and can be mistakenly be deleted if the Last Used date looks as if it was never used.,This would be a big aid to us as we're trying to consolidate a lot of our workflows using process builder and it isn't clear which templates are more used than others.  Most of our email templates are exclusively used via workflow actions.,Would like to understand why the LastUsedDate and TimesUsed isn't captured when used in a workflow, approval process.  Does this also mean when sent via a Flow?,If we are using these email templates through salesforce IQ, will the times used field be updated?,We are going through an effort to clean up our email templates and are finding it difficult to determine when last used because of how the fields are updated.  This would be very helpful for maintenance purposes.
Need One Close and Create Task Window,Jennie Van Remmen,Under Point Threshold,40,0
Option to choose auto-populate between Account and Contact,Jo Stuart,Under Point Threshold,130,1,I agree - I created a custom field for the company URL on the Contact level since it wasn't previously there, and I can't seem to find a way to have the field auto-populate when adding a new contact to the existing account.If anyone figures this out,please let me know!
Disallow file deletion based on user profile permission,Jenny Tse,Under Point Threshold,2030,15,None,Same as a pervious comment, this prevents using Salesforce as a repository for documents.,This is critical.  As everyone knows, if you don't lock down the option to delete - users will use it.  Should have been a basic feature on an earlier version of Salesforce.,We would require to achieve the functionality that," some users sould have create/upload File permission only but not to delete the File eventhough he/she is the Owner of it or users have the Modify all permission on object level from related list ""Files"" of the Object detail page. Only specific users needs to allow for deleting the files based on selected profile users.",None,This affects me as well,I believe we all should be able to delete what we put but nothing from someone else sometimes we make errors and have to edit a note or file and cant do that So Yes its a great idea not to be able to delete something anyone else has attached or comments on in the File,This is critical functionality for audit and operational purposes,I agree - definately a needed security feature,Most frustrating is that there is an object for contracts which would be inhernatly need to be controled yet you cannot stop users from deleting the attached PDFs. Im going to strugle to ge the legal team on board if we cannot remove the ability to delete. Creating a new object to contain the records will be cumbersome and annoying ,None,On cases, we would like the ability to disable Del on Activity History, Emails, and Attachments ,Surprise we can not control this access ourselves. Really should be implemented as soon as possible,obsolutely required,This is a critical requirement for our company as well !!
Automatically refresh views,John Hanna,Product Team Review,2710,15,This would make life a lot easier when multiple people are working out of the same queue!,We are using service cloud console, crazy that tasks or cases can be missed if the user doesn't press refresh.  Please add this asap,The autorefresh is a needed functionality to manage service requests from customers with a team.,Solves quite a few issues,It would be cool ,It is a must,So blindingly obvious a requirement I had presumed it was not possible in a browser or it would have already been implemented.  What were the designers thinking?,It's obvious, logical functionality. ,None,It is crazy that 30 agents must contantly push refresh when they come in the morning to pick off cases from the Support Queue. Just to make sure they aren't working on the same thing. I am told that this is not an issue in Zen Desk and it could delay my this go live because this might be a deal breaker for Support Management. So now we have got to haul off and write custom code for something that seems so basic.,I can't believe this was suggested 7 years ago and there has been no progress? Every user must be pressing Refresh hundreds of times a day and all that's asked for is a simple code change, please review you priority on this.,Great idea - we would specifically like this for queues. ,This sounds a great idea,This would be a huge help. Let's do it,None
Live Agent - Missed Chat reporting,Lee Elkins,Under Point Threshold,330,13,We have the same problem, and one of our architects figured out how to do this, but the field is only viewable by an admin. We have to have an admin send us a report until we can have a reporting field developed to show us the needed detail on the missed chats.,This would be very helpful!,I want this,We really need this!,really need this!,We are missing out on a very important piece of data. Must have.,Would be great to see more details about missed chats, especially if we can distinguish between chats that were intentionally ended by the customer vs chats that were lost for network or other reasons.,Yes it will be helpful,Yes it will be helpful,I found there is a WaitTime field on the Transcript," but it only seems to apply to chats that are taken.  All missed chats have an Owner of ""Automated Process"" and a WaitTime of null.  This I guess that is b/c WaitTime is calculated by RequestTime - StartTime", but the chat never started.   We need this data!,I wish I could vote for this a hundred times.  We hold our chat reps to picking up incoming chats within a definied number of seconds, otherwise they get dinged.  The older standalone Live Agent product gave us that info.,This would definitely help our business out. Our push timeout is currently set to 15 seconds for some skills and 30 seconds for others. When reading through the Chat Transcript Event logs I sometimes see that a chat was requested and declined (or visitor left chat) within the first minute. It would be nice to see if the visitor hung around to chat for 1 second or 29 seconds before leaving the chat request they started.,This would be extremely helpful.

Increase Report Buckets limits,Jennifer Rock,Product Team Review,7870,15,This is needed.,Yes would make the feature more useable if we can increase all limits.,Yes, this is definitely necessary!  At least the number of values per bucket should be increased from 20 to 100+  Otherwise we end up exporting to excel to do A LOT of time consuming manual manipulation. ,we love buckets and really need the limits expanded for our use. ,This would be really helpful!  Thanks!,We need this!,Completely agree- these limits are frustrating,Will be very helpful...,The idea is in voting for 4 years??! Lets forget about it, folks...,Please increase limit...this is definately a need.,Definitely an enhancement that needs to be considered urgently.  The desire to drive more reporting directly from Salesforce, and not excel is key for adoption.  Seems there are many 'Bucketing' Ideas which request similar requirements.,None,I had a problem that the bucket was to complex, hopefully increseing the limits will help with this also.,Great idea since I really need more buckets for certain reports that I don't want to have to breakdown into brackets.,Yes! Great idea!

SOAPFault Information for Apex,Michael Norton,Under Point Threshold,920,15,Salesforce as part of an ecosystem of applications that a company owns. Many of our integrations are SOAP based hence I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to keep the WSDL2Apex functionality current. This issue affects us big time and I hope Salesforce prioritizes.    ,Much needed. Wasted couple of error trying to understand the error messages and fix the issue by rewriting the whole thing. Much needed!,We need this functionality to meet the SOAP standard protocol in order to be able to read the error messages.,Has this been resolved? This is paramount and I am not getting the entire fault envelope,Wsdl2apex is useless without this being fixed.,We are new customer of salesforce and I am really suprised that sfdc is not supporting this basic SOAP principle. we have to implemented workaround which cost time and money ,It trully is unnacceptable this is sitting here for 7 years.  Unlike the OP, I also need from Salesforce to be able to work with custom fault types, not just the string response.,It's a must have. Come on Salesforce why it is taking so long to get this feature.,None,None,Must have, please make life of developers easier.,How I miss .NET...,None,Just started playing with this stuff and was surprised that SFDC doesn't fully support such a basic aspect of the SOAP protocols.  Seriously?,I agree with Kyle as SalesForce is already reading some contents inside the fault but not alllowingg the user to navigate to the nodes inside the fault block. I'd really like to see some kind of solution on this.
Allow creating favorites in Lightning Console apps,Marc D Behr,Under Point Threshold,50,5,None,None,Yes this is so needed! Users will want to save favorites within a Console App, especially when one has been created to help give them specified information they use day to day. ,Console apps are very powerful for users and the noticeable absense of adding favorites really detracts from their usefulness. Please add this ASAP.,Seems like basic functionality to me as well.  If you can access favorites from console, you should be able to save them as well.
Mass update Chatter Profile photos,Ciaran Coyne,Product Team Review,3110,15,Yes please, we want to upload the same images that are in our corporate address book in Outlook, to which staff do not have access. We don't want to rely on them uploading their own photos.,+1,This is a must feature.,None,Please update.,This would be very helpful.  Depending on users to do it themselves isn't practical and doing it one-by-one is too painful.  The User Photo Uploader app mentioned below doesn't appear to be available any more.  ,None,Is there a mass update option for standard user profiles in Sales Force?,+1,Since the image is exposed externally, it would be a big beneift to be able to reset a stock company image.,needed,Love it.,Please help to add this feature.,None,Please add this feature. We have been asked by multiple clients to upload their employee roster and it's super tedious/ painful. 
increase field size on long text fields,Katy Kear,Under Point Threshold,1090,15,None,voted, please support my similar idea for Salesforce1 https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000LmlGQAS,Is this still not a feature?  The tiny size of the field, and having to manually expand the box is very annoying to my users and almost none of them use it.  Our VP of Sales is going to be cracking the whip on this and it would be very useful to be able to change the default size of the Comment field in Activities for example.   ,How can this not be part of the software, that field is TINY and UNUSABLE!,This is a must have feature.,Our reps have to drag the box, make it big and then put the comments in. It just too much time consuming. We need the ability to resize the description box.,@Salesforce This is a concern for many customers. I think it would be great if gets implemented.,Our users are complaining a lot about this as well,I support this change and would be a feature. We are facing problem with this due to users not able to enter their comments and end up writing notes.,Seems rediculous to have to point out just how small some of the text fields are.  Please make it really  easy to change the default size of them.,I agreee with the other users.  It's annoying that for a field of 32000 charachters, only less then 1% of the caracters is visible...  Please add this option asap.,I agree, this would be a good feature.,None,We are trying to encourage more of our customers to use the portal. This restriction isn't helping and we have received negative feedback. The initial size of the field as displayed in edit mode should at least be configurable to allow administrators to create useful space for its contents.,I agree that the edit mode should allow a user to see everything that is in the text box.  We have a description section in all our object pages (LEAD, CONTACT, ACCOUNT).  It would be very helpful if we could see everything while we are editing; otherwise, we have to edit in such a small area that we can't see the entire layout of what we are typing.  So, in order to see what it looks like, we have to type, then close, then see how it looks on the page, then open up edit again if there are more changes to be made.  Making the WHOLE text box area viewable in Edit mode would avoid all this going back and forth!

More than 255 characters in a Long Text Area Custom Field is not visible in the,Sunil Keshari,Not Planned,7220,16,All, thanks for the continued feedback on this. Our goal is to be transparent with our plans, which, in this case, is that this functionality is not currently on our roadmap. The tough reality is that we have finite resources to address a large number of high priority ideas for this product area. In an ideal world, we would do everything our customers ask for. Unfortunately, the product team has to make some tough decisions. Current investments are focused on delivering an amazing analytics experience in Lightning. We will continue to share your feedback on this issue with our product team for them to consider as they develop their future roadmap. ,We need this, it´s so important to have the complete data.,This feature would be very beneficial, as we have many departments that rely on reports for getting there information vs a computer screen. This would be a great assist to have.,None,I gave up on Saleforce some years ago, and trying in again.  I want to link to OneNote Note which I'm using beacuse the notes are so crap in sales force.  Not sure how anyone in the IT sector can use cases, cause to add screen shots (which I may have multiples) I have to save the files, and upload to server, etc.   OneNote simply paste an type...  Now I find I cannot link paste a link to OneNote,We need this too,None,Why would you have a field size larger than you allow to print? I have users put  detailed information in the large text field BECAUSE it is so large. My users need to see that information.,Please reconsider and add it to your roadmap.,"It's indeed insane this had not been implemented in 10 years time while they keep increasing prices for their ""new developments"". This tool did the job for us however until we just decided to move to Zoho CRM: http://www.cloud4j.com/report-builder.html",It is completely INSANE that you cannot view more than 255 in a string. How will my meeting attendees (that don't hold a SF license) know what the last update was? Evolve Salesforce, e-v-o-l-v-e,I need this!,Jennifer, I think what you are not getting is that though this may not be high on the list of priorities for the team there, this is a VERY REAL issue.  This is why so many of us are kind of gobsmacked that SF are not seeing this as an issue. Can you please all have another look at this?  Hoping someone there is actually reading these posts.  ,This is hugely important to us and we need this implemented urgently.,This causes us massive issues! Qualitative data is as important to us as quantitative. our team mates take their time to actually provide qualitative feedback, yet we can't download all of it in Excel which is simply unacceptable. We depend on the reviews to be comprehensive, performance is everything at our firm.,This is REALLY needed!
Increase Name field length from 80 to 255,Tony Coleman,Product Team Review,5220,16,Hi all, thank you for your feedback. This is currently on our long-term roadmap.,None,After the proxy encrytion,the name field needs much more than 80 characters.  ,Sooner the better. Upvoting to get this in prod as soon as possible.,Must have- very limitiing,Hi all, thank you for your feedback. This is currently on our long-term roadmap.,None,Our Opportunity records are converted to generate a custom object, the custom object record name won't allow as many characters as the Opportunity name which is causing no end of problems for us.  The length of time your customers continue to ask for fairly simple fixes (on some issues it's 8-10 years) with very little or no acknowledgement from Salesforce is ridiculous! Please fix.,None,Agreed. We need this to happen asap.,3 years past and....nothing!!,For me, particularly problematic when dealing with custom content integrations as content entry names are frequently longer than 80 characters.,What to choose what to choose..,None,I was troubled . It is , when I migrate  Oppotunity and Quote of the standard object to a custom object , is that the number of digits in the Name column was not enough .I am very happy when it is improved .,None
Need Sharing Rules for Activities,Paula Vogler,Not Planned,6650,16,At this time, we have no plans to support sharing rules on activities.  If our plans change we will update this idea.,None,None,How do we not have this yet after 7 Years!  Sharing activities for our small teams is a must for us.,6490 points.  Yeah, it doesn't look like this is in any demand.,Please consider implementing this. 'Controlled by parent' on activities will mean that everyone who can amend the account record copuld also amend the activities.  I just want to be able to allow certain support teams to be able to amend a small group of users' activities.  This seems like it should be a very simple solution, I don't understand the reluctance to consider it.,None,This is needed feature,Dynamics CRM have this function since ever.,Just like everyone else it seems, I can think of way more reasons that this would be beneficial, than excuses for why it's a bad idea.,It's a imporatnt feature and we really need it.,None,Hi all, it's highly unlikely we will put an additional/separate sharing model on Activities due to performance. We want to provide the optimum experience and if we were to put an additional layer of sharing on top of activities (the biggest table in Salesforce), it wouldn't create an ideal user experience for our customers.,Please consider enabling sharing settings for activities! ,Yet another thing Salesforce ignores.....,Territory Management helps the sales team, but if you cannot follow Role based, it is impossible to share events and tasks without relating them to an object with other permissions? 
See Sandbox refresh date/time from the Sandbox,Amber Boaz,Under Point Threshold,410,9,None,None,Details about sandbox last refresh and type etc should be accebile within in the logged in sandbox without production access. That would be very useful.,I feel this would be useful.,None,Agreed - would be helpful and surely easy to implement.,You could also download the setup audit trail.  That shouldn't go back any later than the refresh date of the sandbox.,None,I look at the most recent user login date/time in the sandbox for users that are not using the sandbox.  That's will give you a very close refresh time.
Developer Editions for Marketing Cloud - Radian6, ExactTarget & Pardot,Maria Pergolino,Under Point Threshold,940,10,Desperately needed,If you want to expand the usage of these systems our teams need to have the experience in a test environment.  This is clearly understood on the force.com side and wonderfully supported.  Is this an intentional barrier Salesforce is putting up?,None,Partner enablement for Pardot and Marketing Cloud is sadly missing at the moment.  While training and certification exists access to training and development environments is missing.  Our parnter manager is keen for us to acquire the necessary skills but is unclear on what the enablement process is and how to get us access to a training environment.  This is a major barrier to on-boarding the necessary skills.  In the UK I have seen Salesforce partners use HubSpot with their clients becuase the support they recieve is much better.  Partners are missing out on opportunities to sell Pardot or Marketing Cloud licenses.  There's a risk that this business will go elsewhere, either to antoher technology vendor or to a digital agency meaning marketing becomes another silo with little to no integration.,None,Much needed.,Yes, please!,Developer edition will be helpful.,Developer edition to check all salesforce capability would be a benefit for my tests,Training and Implementation as well as creation of new apps that works with Marketing Cloud would be really beneficial to all parties.
SSL for Vanity URLs,Justin Clark,Product Team Review,5330,16,Support for SSL for Vanity Domains is currently under development. We plan to roll it out to customers in the Winter release as a pilot. Please connect with your Account Executive if you are interested in the pilot. ,Support for SSL for Vanity Domains is currently under development. We plan to roll it out to customers in the Winter release as a pilot. Please connect with your Account Executive if you are interested in the pilot. ,need ASAP, this is becoming a serious issue for us.,Not sure why we are all being asked to vote on this.  Pardot and Salesforce are losing credibility because it has been in the hopper for so long and no one is providing updates.  Becomes a waste of time to vote it up.  Agree with David, the work-arounds are too painful to be even discussed, let alone implemented.  We purchased Pardot because of ease of use, but this solution is not easy.  ,None,Is there any update on this since February? ,None,None,None,None,None,It seems like this idea is being reviewed by the product team and that Salesforce will come with a response in 2-4 months. Does anyone know when this status has been changed? So I will have an idea on when to expect a response from Salesforce. I'm currently working on a client and this is an issue for using the Pardot landing pages.,None,None,This is hugely important - especially when using a CDN like Cloudflare, the additional overhead that is created to maintain the ability to use non-secure vanity URLs significantly devalues the benefit provided.,Agree with Justin Rogers.  I advocated for Pardot as well.  I think the fact that Salesforce provides SSL for files for public consumption should work for Pardot files as well.  As a default option.  Then let's worry about the vanity URLs after that.  
Dashboard Auto-Refresh,Jarrod Johnson,Product Team Review,4060,16,Hi Everyone- the product team reviewing this request.  As you can imagine, enabling a feature like this requires careful consideration to assess potential impact it may have. The team is continuing to assess and review, but there is no ETA at the moment. ,On the new Lightning Home Page, when using Chart Components, there is not even a way to manually refresh them.,This would be very helpful. Particularly as one considers the move from Classic to Lightning, and scheduling refreshes manually is no longer an option.,Com'on guys! You can always add conservative governor limits to reduce the risk on the potential impact that this may have ;),The original request was 6 years ago and the comment was 11 months ago.  Seems like that is a long time to be carefully considering.,None,Would be helpful in Lightning as well. Currently using WalkMe to remind people to refresh their dynamic dashboards.,This idea would make Dashboards that much more usable,I have to say, I receive the same shocked looks from colleagues that this does not happen automatically.,This is a much requested feature. Colleagues are shocked that this does not happen automatically.,None,None,None,Hi Everyone- the product team reviewing this request.  As you can imagine, enabling a feature like this requires careful consideration to assess potential impact it may have. The team is continuing to assess and review, but there is no ETA at the moment. ,Yes," please. A lot of data is important to have current and is not based off of ""last week"," or last year"". If people don't realize that the data is not current", they could make business decisions based on out-dated data. ,I would like to see this as well. It would greatly help our support team.
allow dynamic content variations based on multiple criteria,Heather Stables,Under Point Threshold,640,3,Or allow embedding %%dynamic_content_#%% inside other %%dynamic_content_##%%,None,This is something that Marketo offers - without it we are so limited in our ability to use dynamic content. Can you please please please look into it
Changing Account ownership,tlgardener,Product Team Review,3840,15,None,Why is there a checkbox to transfer Open Opportunities to the new Account Owner if the system is going to do it automatically anyway? Here we've been thinking that since we didn't check the box, the Opp stayed with the original owner.  This is a really bad design flaw and incredibly irritating!,Much needed. This would save admins lots of time. ,will be good to have this features along with setting to handle the OWD/record acccess when dont want to change the ownership of the related records of acoount,"After 9 years and no movement on a basic feature that you would think could be implemented.  Have a checkbox on the screen that says ""Do Not Change Contact Owners for the Account"" that could be selected.  This is EASY! ",desprately needed,We also need this to NOT happen, automatically change opportunity ower when changing account owner.,This is a real issue for us as well. Our sales areas change on a frequent basis, but any open opps, tasks etc. will stay with the original owner. At the moment when an account changes owner, the original salesperson then has to go into all the open opportunities and tasks for that account and change the owner back to themselves.This is incredibly time consuming. Please give us the option not to transfer open opps and tasks etc.,This is very frustrating.  We have account managers that handle our clients.  We have sales people that manage the individual opportunities.  A sales person will not own an account and an account manager will not own an opporutnity.  The feature of having the opportunities mandatorily transfered was poorly conceived and needs to be rectified.,None,This is urgently needed by so many companies and has been a long standing issue. Please Salesforce, make it an option to let us choose whether to reassign the contacts associated with an account when reassigning the account.,Salesforce, this function is needed urgently in our company and as by the looks of it many other companies also. As this idea came up 9 YEARS ago, would you have any idea when you will take the time to review and give the users some feedback if we can expect this feature anytime soon? ,Desperately need ability to change the account owner without changing the opportunity owner and open tasks. This creates lots of extra work to go back in reassign items when we want the historical owner to be maintained. ,This is hugely irritating. Please make it possible to change acount owner and not contact owner.,Need abilty to change account owner without changing contact owner.

Allow for prospects to run through Engagement Studio more than once,Jack Corrao III,Under Point Threshold,1200,9,Please do this - it would be extremely helpful!,This would be super helpful especially with recurring annual campaigns. ,Has there been any progress on this feature?   This feature would be incredibly helpful if implemented to avoid having to create a work around the requires setting up duplicates of the same engagement plan.,This is a no-brainer and it's ridiculous that it isnt already possible. Marketo has had this for years ... it is so frustrating to have to beuild either REALLY long programs or feed prospects from one to another to another just so there is continuity.,Has anyone been able to come up with a creative workaround for this? I've thought about using different combinations of lists and automation rules but to no avail,This would make things like annual renewal programs much easier as you would not have to create one for each year.,We are trying to build a automated sign up process and we need to have the prospect going through the same Engagement Studio again and again in case of abandon cart. Very limited as is today.,this would be fantastic to have! We use engagement programs for knowledge paths. Sometimes, the end user wants to start over again because things came up. Right now, we don't have a solution for those people to re-start the program. This would be super powerful. Please contact me if you want detailed feedback.,Pardot, you really need to update your technology.  You are a couple years behind the automation systems with what you offer, yet you price yourself comparatively.  Instead of a simple, single engagement studio to move prospects through a content funnel I am trying to create, I literally have to create 25 different flows to do the same thing. 
List View Sharing by Role in Lightning,Nicole Rothermel,Under Point Threshold,30,1,Essential!
Increase number of custom fields,Elizabeth Walchuk,Under Point Threshold,990,15,We need this yesterday! Thisnis critical for the business. How many votes do you need to increase the limit? ,yes, this is a complaint from customers of ours,We have had SFDC for 10 years during that time business has been growing, changing, and evolving - we need to be able to accomodate the needs of customers.  Really need to be able to work around the limit of 800 field for the Opportunity Object.,We need more than 800 custom fields, we are strongly needing this!,We need more than 500 fields.,This idea has been open for a long time...,I agree. more than 500 fields,Same here. Hit 500 custom fields limit on an object. Need to have more.,We have a growing number of product lines, and each has different field requirements to capture data. We are closely hitting 500 and would like access to more.,It would really help to have more than 500 custom fields on a single object. Any timeline on when this could be possible?,I cannot believe that we are still stuck with a limit of custom fields within an object.  As an enterprise solution, this limit needs to be removed.,Would be nice to have, even if it's a paid option.,Need an increase as well. Doing a related object is not ideal for efficiency,Running out of fields -- could we purchase more?,Definitely needed.  Surprised there arent options for extending.
Managed Package License Reporting,Ted Gordon,Product Team Review,3480,15,definitely need this,None,Would make life as an admin so much easier.,Essential ,Yes, this is needed for verifying the app license in the custom logic and for reporting.,This is needed for auditing ,Critial for efficient license management. Our users change teams and roles often and we need this to make sure the licences are currently assigned to the users who need them. ,A much needed feature!,This would be helpful,This would be wonderful, to minimally export the user license information to be able to report/sort.,This is a much NEEDED feature. Not only for auditing purposes, but for the ability to provide accurate counts of Users using the licenes without having to go into each Installed Package, and see the whole org in a single place. This will be a HUGE timesaver. ,"We use a number of licensed packages and ""who has access to what?"" is a question we are frequently asked by mgmt who pay for those licenses. This would provide a simple solution to that question. ",None,None,This is a much needed enhancement, screenshots make for terrible reporting standards
"Ability to change edit page buttons - e.g. get rid of ""Save & New"" button",Susan Price,Under Consideration,7300,16,None,This is required for SF classic as well.,Echoing what others said.  I have a custom object called participant that creates records that relate to a custom object called program.  When adding a participant to a program, the user can select from the list of contacts or add a new contact which then is added to the participant record.  If they do save and new when creating the new contact, they can create lots of new contacts but they still only have the one new participant record.  It gives the impression that they are adding all of those new contacts to the program but in reality they are just creating lots of new contacts but still have to create lots of new participation records.,Need for Classic,Need this for SF Classic as well, have processes were we do not want users using the Save and New button at all, ablity to choose which buttons appear on an edit of any other page should be basic functionality,Really need this since working with different record types and trying to save people from too many clicks just to create child records.  Please make it available in classic!,Just want to echo what others have said: if SF saw it necessary to deprecate the use of JavaScript in home page components back in Summer '15, then it would have been considerate to roll out this seemingly simpe, easy," and straightforward functionality. Kinda crazy it's still ""in limbo""",Please include to Salesforce classic too. Not only for internal users but also for i.e. partner portal and customer portal users.,None,For Classic - We can't seem to have Save and Close for internal users but not Community users. Please don't do this only for LEX,It is a basic request which is not delivered in last 8 years !,Our org use the customer community and the Napai template.  With our update to Winter '17," our users suddenly have this ""Save & New"" button while editing records", but we prefer to use global actions for creating new records. They can now circumvent this and our Flows are no longer being triggered correctly.  It's created a huge mess, we really need to a way to disable this button, either by object, profile, record type, etc.,The Save and New buttons were not in Lightning up until Winter '17. This was perfect for us since we force users to create new records from actions where important data is prefilled behind the scene. Now that the Save and New buttons have been added, the user experience is getting more complex since users can created incomplete and inaccurate data from too many places. Please make this at least an object setting so that we can chose to enable the Save and New button or not for each object.,Really needed, and something that should be made available in Classic, not just Lightning. Save & New is simply not appropriate for many use cases.,"We have to mitigate a lot of user error because of the inability to remove buttons from the edit layout.  Our users come back to use with the classic complaint of ""Salesforce is broken!"" because we can't remove the Save and New from Cases.  A little help", please??,This would be great! I noticed that Save & New isn't available in Lightning Experience currently, so adding this ability would allow us to not only remove the Save & New button, but add it where it doesn't exist.
Add Describe Field Result Method To Get Dependent Picklist Values,Boris Bachovski,Under Point Threshold,2350,15,This is needed ASAP. An example would be to retrieve all State values for its parent Country. Currently, we have a large map storing unnecessary data. SF, get onto this!,None,Its good feature need to introduce a new method,I'm replacing an old VF form with a Lightning Out form.  So," given there is not any component like ""apex:inputField"" in Lightning Out"," this is really needed to offer ""apex:inputField"" similar functionality for picklist fields.",This is needed ASAP,This is definitively a miss...,valuable for our developers!,This gap really needs to be closed in Apex. I bet there is a lot of resource-intensive, kludgy code on the platform that could be retired if this was implemented!,It is required feature in my scenario also. Please provide it ASAP,Yes, i am also facing same issue, Please help me on this? its most important who are doing customization for there application using Apex. So Team please try to implement method to retrieve dependent value.,None,Indeed, this is needed.,This will be a great help to the Apex developers.,Its a very required business scenarion you want to know what is the value in parent and child using apex.,Any org using flow and dependant picklists would really benefit from this idea.
Email-2-Case Creates Multiple Cases on the Same Email Thread,Jeff Butler,Under Point Threshold,780,15,Badly affecting to our clients, need to have a solution soon,same issue,Subscribing to this issue as we're experiencing similar wasted time processing unecessary duplicates.,None,Have the same issue. Any tip will help.,+1 for this. Does anyone have a custom resolution to it in the mean time?,same issue,One way to resolve this issue is to put the case thread Id in every template used for auto response. Just change the color scheme of the text so it will blend with the email template background and cannot be seen. Works great for us.,We needs this! ,The lack of this logical functionality is killer. We just migrated from Zendesk to Salesforce and a lot of smaller yet time-consuming things like this are starting to make me regret it.,This should be included in email to case feature. We're migrating from Zendesk to Salesforce. Zendesk can do this by default, why salesforce can't?,Same issue here. Really need a solution for this.,None,None,None
Creating recurring tasks with a New Task quick action.,Kumar Suyash,Under Point Threshold,20,0
Embed Report in Email Templates,Diane Frey,Under Point Threshold,190,5,Would love if reports could be integrated into email templates! This would save us a lot of time of searching throught the report, pulling out the data and putting together an email each week.  ,We are discovering that we need this functionality more and more....,None,cool idea!,Could really help when you need to email with data from a one-to-many object, like a confirmation that contains header detail and details from the child record(s). Instead of making a VF template, you could embed a report and have that report generated based on criteria passed.
Add scoring rules that detect lack of activity.,Derrick Delliquadri,Product Team Review,2860,0
Enable Date fields for use with the Bucket Fields feature,Matthew Lamb,Product Team Review,6800,15,We already use formula fields to get around this limitation, but it's not nearly as flexible as bucketing.  My org would use this feature on a daily basis!,Dont know if this helps anyone, but I have a formula field that calculates the number of days between two days. Then I just bucket using that field. ,None,None,Totally voting for this idea. I've had several encounters when putting reports together wishing I could present data grouped by dates and timestamp in a more streamlined manner.,We've just changed our commission tiers to be project age related and this would be super hepful for forecasting,Really need this to be delivered . It would be good if Salesforce enables this feature soon.,None,"Make it a ""Bucket-list"" item !",None,This helps to be more pro-active to our customers. Also, it is more time efficient!,This is a good idea!,Sounds good to me! Will help in some report cases which are now not easy to solve.,Good idea!,Please develop this idea as it should improve analysis on many subjects
Adding images while composing HTML Emails,Vanessa Voisard,Under Consideration,3840,15,This seems like a pretty standard functionality these days, why can't the HTML case response window function like a G Suite interface?,Yes needed! This would highly perform the SF Adoption among our users and save so much time...... ,None,My Customer Service team recently migrated from Outlook to using Cases. And this is a major pain point for them.,If Google Mail can do it why not Salesforce? We would use Communities if this was possible.,Absolutely need this feature, please make this happen Salesforce Team!,The inability to add screenshots is is a HUGE issue for us in our move to Service Cloud.  It is disappointing to see that this critical request has been outstanding for over two years.,None,None,None,We really need this feature to be able to explain processes to customers in an ordered flow. ,This would be extremely beneficial for us, really surprised to find out SFDC doesn't have this already. ,The value of being able to add screenshots to our emails cannot be overstated.  This woudl cut down on process time, thereby saving money for the company and more importantly, lend to a better customer experience.  This is a must.  If Salesforce is not technologically advanced enough for this basic need that is unfortunate.  ,With an attachment process that takes more than the typical number of steps when compared to other programs and requires creating separate documents with images or snapshots, I believe this would be a fantastic feature to add to Sales Force.,This would greatly improve efficiency and increase the speed of closing cases.
Lightning Experience: Run report without saving,Penny Hammond,Product Team Review,4850,16,Hi all, thanks for your feedback and patience. This idea is very high on our list of priorities and we are working on fixing this.,Hi all, thanks for your feedback and patience. This idea is very high on our list of priorities and we are working on fixing this.,I used this feature 10x a day - really is a must have in the Lightning experience.  If we have to save each time we will need to create a folder just for 1x report to run and then delete them.,None,Thanks @Marko Koosel. I'm contacting with our TAM for it.,None,None,This is critical for our day-to-day functions and should be added back as soon as possible.,None,Truly a must have,We have a pilot for a new report builder coming in Summer'17 and we are hoping to GA in Winter'17 (Safe harbor). We will be posting more information about the pilot in Reports & Dashboards chatter group very soon. Thanks,Thank you for the update Marko. Can you comment on an expected release time frame?,Hello all, we are working on a new Lightning Report Builder and we are going to allow running reports without saving them first. Thanks for all your feedback.,This is such an obvious must have!,Currently use this feature frequently in Classic.,Disappointing!  Come on Salesforce - this is so basic.
Edit default Salesforce Engage email template,Byron Shettle,Under Point Threshold,200,2,This is a mandatory need. ,I couldn't agree more!!
Prevent email deletion,Miguel Guerreiro,Under Point Threshold,1130,15,It is amazing to me that we have no way to stop users from deleting emails. Typically we do not allow users to delete ANYTHING so this is a huge miss in our security process. Can you please advise on when a solution can be expected?,None,This would be extremely helpful.  It's amazing to me that there are not persmissions for this.,None,None,Does anyone know if you leverage the validation rules associated to Emails when you have Enhanced Email enabled, if this would be an option for preventing deletions? New feature pushed out in a recent release. ,This is definitely functionality that is necessary, especially in service centers where emails need to be tracked for historical audits.  To think that there's no easy way to prevent users from deleting emails sent from the system is a bit mind boggling to me.,Should be able to control if emails can be deleted or not, by profile or Permisision set.,Must have this option! It's a big risk that we allow users to delete email messages!!,I'm also surprised the delete link for emails cannot be hidden.  Why would you need to delete an email that has been sent which is  this is such a basic part of the history on that case.  Terrible hole for auditing purposes!,Quite surprised, something this basic isn't implemented in 7 years! We really need this.,This would be very helpful.  Its amazing to me that there is no CRUD on this object.,We need this feature badly.,None,My previous post is incorrect -- you CAN use a before delete trigger and AddError to prevent a deletion. My apologies for the incorrect information.
Ability to temporarily (or semi-permanently) skip a given unit test,David Hagman,Under Point Threshold,170,3,None,None,Probobly makes more sense as an attributre on the @isTest annotation since the apex team seems to be trying to avoid new keywords. Something like @isTest(disabled=true) would make a lot of sense.
Access Levels for Folder sharing not visible or manageable via data loader,Nauman Khan,Under Point Threshold,410,8,Necessary !!,It will be very usefull,This functionalaity is needed. ,This will be really help ful to have have feture like this.  I received lot of like this request from our business.,We've just had an issue where the enhanced sharing was inadvertently turned off.  When turned back on, all of the sharing permissions previously applied were lost.  Being able to update quickly by using data loader and a sandbox file would be ideal!,None,Will be good in case of mass sharing with users whuch dont fit the critrea,It this age of automation there is no reason why these and all profile permissions including object and FLS shouldn't be exposed.
"Add ""Where is it used ?"" button for Public Group",Marie ORANGE,Product Team Review,4220,16,None,Voted - any kind of reconciliation of large numbers of PGs is almost impossible.,This one would be huge help for big companies with hundreds of public groups! Voted !,I am doing a major clean up to an org that has been around since 2008 and having this would be valuable.  ,This is very much needed.  It is hard to manage public groups when you can't easily see where the public groups are being used.,None,"I'd love the ""Where is this Used?"" feature", but even the addition of a description field would be a step in the right direction.,Since public groups can be used in a variety of was which include sharing rules, folder access, and list views, we need to be able to determine what impact it will have if we add or remove users from a group. This feature would be very helpful for access auditing.,We are currently in the process of doing an entire org clean-up (public groups, queues, sharing rules, profiles, roles, etc). It would be very helpful to be able to quickly identify where public groups are being used in order to help in this process. This is definitely needed, I hope that it will be re-evaluated soon. ,None,None,Please update the status of this long-standing (and likely easily fixed) roadblock for admins.,Any update from Salesforce on when this was put into Product Review and when we can expect it? It has become a real issue for us not to having a way to see if a group is tied to a sharing rule, or a library folder, a chatter group, or approval process, or...I ca go on and on!!.   Definitely need this functionality.  An update would be great because we desperately need this in order to do some housekeeping . ,Just ran into a situation where this would have saved me a crazy amount of time. An update from Salesforce would be greatly appreciated. ,Something that sounds so simple but seems to take Salesforce so long to do anything about. Seems quite a common occurance really. An update would be great though as we really need this too in order to do some housekeeping. ,Any update from Salesforce on when this was put into Product Review and when we can expect it? Definitely need this functionality.
Highlight Multiple Fields on Multi-Field Validation Errors,Patrick Maxwell,Under Point Threshold,760,6,This is the usually question from new user. It will help to push user adoption.,this is a fine idea!,Drives me crazy trying to work out which fields are mandatory when they are not highlighted as such!,We need this very bad in our Org. It is confusing to our users when they have multiple fields to fill out after an update. The only workaround is changing the record type and page layout," but that requires a save and can cause more data integrity issues. Would also like the ""Sales Path"" functionality available in the browser", not just SF1. If Sales Path was available in Desktop that would be a good workaround as well. ,There are many times when we have an average of 5 fields referencing each other.  It would really help to see those fields referenced.,None

"Ability to Customize the ""Create New"" homepage component",Mike Gerholdt,Product Team Review,2920,15,Still waiting for this to happen!,We have custom visualforce pages for certain objects and currently the create new overrides our business process.  It would be greate if we could customize the create new links to launch our VF pages instead of the standard SF pages.,None,None,Agreed, when it comes to custom business processes and disalllowing standard ways of doing things, the ability to customize the Create New is critical. The option of removing this from the layout is quite sub-optimal and hence there should be a way of arranging  menu items and removing those objects which you would not like users to create.,None,This would be great!,This needs to happen, why give the ability to be able to remove the Create New from the home page but not from the Individual Object pages.,+1,+1,I agree with alot of the comments below. We have specific business flows around creating Opportunities and I would love to exclude them from this menu.,Agreed! ,Yes please, I would like to remove the options to create a new account or contact as in our organization these need to be created via a lead to keep clear and consistant data flow.,"The ""Create New..."" replicates the Tabs in the selected App.  Although there is some logic in this methodology"," it is inconsistent with the way that the rest of the Sidebar works.  ""Search"" allows you to select among all objects"," not only those in your App.  Likewise with ""Recent Items"".  It would be useful for the Sidebar to act consistently"," thus allowing all objects to be selected under ""Create New...or to allow a user to make a selection among""App""vs.""All"".  And an Admin should have capability of disabling the choice and providing a defined user experience.",Sometimes custom objects are included in here and we use custom buttons to create records in this object and having a standard create option from here is something which needs to be controled
Increase Custom Setting Name limit to 80 to match Custom Object Name limit,Jeff May,Under Point Threshold,1020,15,I really need this feature.,40 characters are not enough. size increse is needed.,40 characters is not enough and confusing. I even couldn't easily find this size limit.,Needed,This feature is required if Custom Settings need to be considered as a way to implement Organization and other Standard Object specific settings. Please get this increased soon.,This feature is very much needed as that is impacting the existing data to be updated because of the custom setting not allowed more than 40 characters. ,We cannot give meaningful names if the character size is limited to 40 chars. Making it 80 chars will help us to resolve this issue.,It's things like this that make developing in Salesforce a real pain sometimes,I think we should have 80 characters limit for Custom Settings Name field so that Name field length is consistant.,Yes, the length needs to increase. We do use Custom settings to store Agency Names, which can be bigger than 40 characters limit. Increasing limit will make life easy!!,Very needed,This is a no brainer....,The limit is 38 Alphabetic characters, depending on characters used it can be even lower. An increase in Name size would be very helpful.,Even 40 chars are also not supported. It stores only 38 chars.,Need this .
Support Dynamic Creation of All Lightning Component Types (force:inputField),Andrew Carlson,Under Point Threshold,750,12,I can't believe this feature is not possible in Lightning!,Badly needed. Upvote.,None,I can't believe its not an option! is there any work around at least ?,This would save us so much time and this would be very helpful!,We need this feature available as it would help in developing the required UI experience.,Can't use lightning without this!,Can't live without this fix! Breaking a lot of our custom features right now.,This is much needed and very helpfull feature to make dynamic UI.,We have 80 different products with different layout and functinality, currently we have this in VF ,Badly loking for solution in Lighting.,This is reqiured feature to make configurable UI,Much needed feature. How is this not in the framework?

Process Builder start to include Attachments,Alastair Dinning,Under Point Threshold,520,4,Agreed, i would like to have this,Need to start a process based on Attachments and/or Files.,Please enable this, it would help my organization a lot!,Agreed; this would be great to have.
Report on Notes & Attachments,Melissa Karr,Under Point Threshold,610,15,None,None,this report would be extremely helpful as we continue to push more and more of our business processes inside salesforce,Really need the ability to report on attachments and notes.,Yes this would be really helpful for us.,This would be really useful!,Really need the ability to report on attachments.,Good point, but also the possibility to access via link shoud be amazing.,Our Sales manager is asking for a report that shows the Notes that have been added.,This report will be very helpfull!,Definitely helpfull to have this!,We use naming convention for attachments. This would be useful to see a summary of attachments by user. We don't need the attachment, just the metadata.,Would make some things easier,None,Completely agree. This is pretty simple system logic," to search for ""has attachment"" associated with the record."
Creating product line items from a sigle Bundled Product line,Raul Ortega,Under Point Threshold,2480,15,Our team bundles and then saves them as a favorite to quickly add to the quote.  I can see the value of this functionality.,None,Have Products with multiple components for medical billing and each has a CPT code with a specific price.  Would be very helpful to offer bundling.,This will definitely help our salesforce reduce admin time.,My cmpany would greatly benefit from having this option in Salesforce!,None,Any method of grouping or creating a sub-set within a Pricebook would be very helpful.,None,None,None,None,None,None,I am disappointed there is no such simple function in SF. This is a must for any developing company to have,We need to be able to bundle products, show the bundled price to the customer but be able to follow on profit for each individual prodct that bundle consists of. It would be great to be able to set a discount on the individual product or on the bundle itself.
Report on prospect’s activity (frequency, duration, or number of page views),Tracy Chambon,Under Point Threshold,90,0
"Add ""Version ID"" to the Process Builder's Initial Screen",Derek Davis,Product Team Review,3070,15,Please add this functionality soon. If it's a real estate issue on the Process Builder job screen, a font size adjustment would be an no-brainer value sacrifice.,shouldn't need to use the workaround,This will be very useful when we receive the error email when a process failed.,I just ran into this issue today when I tried a data load and ran into an error asking for Version ID. Please add. It would make figuring out which flow is blocking my data load much easier. Thanks!,None,None,None,None,This would make trouble shooting MUCH easier!,Can save lots of time !,Please consider this.  Having only the id of the flow in the UI makes it very difficult to troubleshoot if you don't receive the email that goes along with the error.,Either this or add the Process name to the error message.,It would be great to be able to see versionn Id, would help a lot in debugging.,None,This would be HUGELY helpful. Any word on it it will be implemented?
Allow DML for OrgWideEmailAddress, EmailServicesFunctio And EmailServicesAddress,Jon Jessup,Under Point Threshold,450,11,Great... another necessary bit of functionality that they didn't implement and probably never will.  As a result, I now have to spend the next several hours looking for the right hoops to jump through to get code coverage on something that verifies the existence of an org-wide email address as a main part of its logic.,This definitely is required for unit testing.,This is required to create a test data in Apex test classes.,Needed for proper unit tests.,A must for unit testing!,In unit tests, it should be allowed to create or update OrgWideEmailAddresses to create test data so that tests are independent from existing org-wide addresses, and to test error handling.,Really need to add the Status field.  It's dangerous to rely on these records without it.,This would be helpful in writing unit tests.,I don't quite understand this either.  It supports those actions from the API, but not from inside of SFDC with Apex?  I guess I'll have to use Apex to call the API to meet the business requirement.  What a hassle.,None,I need this api
Automatically Populate New Custom Fields to Custom Report Type Layout,Darin Batchelder,Product Team Review,2800,15,For a company that is often creating new custom fields, this would be a huge time saver!,This is the reason why we don't use custom report types,I am for this 100%!,Real problem is you can't have more than 1,000 fields in CRT. I believe the first step would be to remove that limit, that doesn't apply to standard report types.,Very much agree this would be useful. Even though I've been aware of this deficiency for ages, somehow I never remember and always start building a new report only to find the new custom field isn't there. Grr... And even if I do manage to remember, it still seems like a pointless step. Even without all the nice configurability options others have mentioned here," a better assumption for the system to make would simply be that I ""want"" the new field added to all the custom report types that use that object. For page layouts", the default is to include the new custom field on all the page layouts, right? You have to explicitly uncheck some boxes if you don't want that to happen, which makes much more sense. If for some unusual reason I really don't want the custom field to be available in a custom report type, I can always go remove it. But really, who would do that?,Yes," this functionality would be helpful. A ""wizard""-type solution would be the best", with options to include/exclude particular fields' availability in different custom reports. Thanks, and let's get to it!,This would be great... especially if when you create the report type you can check whether you want this functionality or not.,When you create a new field, one of the setup screens should be a checkbox to add to all custom report types. If you do not want to add to all, you can go in later and add it to the individual custom report types.,None,I love this idea.  We should be given the option if we want it added to custom report types or not.,I want this SO badly.,None,I agree with the comments - this is an important feature.  I shouldn't have to go in and update the custom report type each time new custom fields are added.,None,Yes, please and Thank You, SFDC
Expand Controlling/Dependent Field Behavior,Mike OConnor,Product Team Review,2650,15,This would be useful especially when wanting to grey out unneeded fields to avoid user confusion,"How after 8 years has this not been implemented... There is no reason that a text field (or any other field type of that matter) can not be a dependent field. Every form anywhere has the ""Other"" radio button and ""Other"" dependent text field.",This is very much needed. The field dependancy functionality must be generalized rather than restricting it to picklists. It really saves a lot of time and effort for developers.,This would be great. It is such a pain having to create a picklist (sometimes triggered by a hidden field) just so you can create a field dependency. ,Would be immensely helpful.,Same goes for our instance.  We want the sales reps to be able to define their own probability % rather than using the Standard % that's tied to a Stage on an Opportunity.  However, limiting this to a picklist of %'s almost defeats the purpose of having another field.,None,None,There is a need to be able to use Task Standard Fields such as Subject as a controlling field.  Somewhat confused as to why this is not an accessible field for this function.  This would easily allow for customization of inputs in all dependent fields quickly and easily. ,None,None,I vote for this as well, its frustrating to not have the ability to use a formula, number, etc field be a controlling field.  Please add this feature!,Would be great to have dependant numerical fields so that analysis/reports coudl be run off of them,This limitation as high impacts, especially in contexts where the user base and business domain is very broad and there are multiple case categories where for example task type have subsets relevant to specific categories. You end up presenting massive task type lists, not conducive to usability nor accuracy for that matter...,We have a Status field which progresses from Prospect > Tentative > Definite or > Turndown > Lost > Cancelled. We have explanation fields for Lost & Turndown but would like to have them hidden/grayed out unless these 2 Statuses are used. This would increase user adoption by reducing confusion. We can make dependent picklists but some of the Lost Explanation fields are text and/or dates.
Allow Field Sets to be added as a Standard Component to Lightning Page Layouts,Carmelo Andronaco,Under Point Threshold,400,4,The field set should render as a section on the record page (Secton header can be a property that can be set when adding the component to the page). This feature will provide the ability to setup different record pages with diferent sections for different Apps and profiles.,This will allow a much more process specific layout of some pages through the separation of fields.,Ideal+  add field sets from any related object keyed off of the field of your choice. ,None
Customizable Sales Teams and Account Teams,Erik Mittmeyer,Partial Delivery in Winter '13,3470,16,Customers can customize Opportunity (Sales) Teams at this point, as of Winter '13.  Customizable Account Team is not yet supported.  Hence the idea is partially implemented.,This is definitely something that is needed in our organization. We have whole teams that work with managed accounts rather than opportunities, so having the ability to customize at the Account Team level is a necessity. It's much more efficient to add two or three fields to this object than have to either add numerous User fields on the account or, even worse, build our own custom object that is essentially Account Teams Plus.,In a large organization, where it is impossible for everyone to know each other, some group identification in the Account Team would be a huge productivity enhancement.,Tagging on to Gareth Williams comment.  We collaborate with many different people across our company.  It would help to see the area/department on our large account teams to know which groups and expertise they bring.,None,The abiltiy to customize Account teams would be very helpful for a project I am working on where a legacy system controls/maintains account teams and passes the info to Salesforce.,Because of some uniqueness to our organization and business proccesses, opportunity teams being customizable is not helpful to us the way customizable account teams would be.,yes, needed,Even though partially implemented (covering opportunity teams), this is still very much needed for Account teams too!,We would also like to have the abililty to restrict (Including Owner) who can add or remove account team members at the profile level.  ,None,We need Account Team Member customization in order to add new fields for when the user was added in the account.,We need Customizable Account Teams, including custom fields, validation rules, workflow, process builder,etc.,Rajit, we NEED Customizable Account Teams, and we need it years ago. When is it coming?,This is such a basic need that it almost always requires us to not use OOB functionality and replicate with a custom object instead.,We desperately need functionality to customize Account Team Members. When will this be delivered?
Override Standard Button with lightning component,Shekhar Gawali,Under Point Threshold,200,1,Its much needed feature to use lightning exprience in extend. 
Expose Running Territory Rules in Apex,Andrew O'Driscoll,Product Team Review,2960,15,Please, fix it,highly required feature, please make this happen!,this is needed. The work around for handling the same is a manual action by Admins or an API based update. Both of these are not very useful methods. Please prioritize this idea,None,Please fix,Please fix it.,Hope it can be resovled,It is quite useful for us. And now we have to do some tricky thing in order to fulfill our requirements.,please fix it.,Facing the impact in our org,This is a huge impact in Territory Management, please fix.,This feature is most wanted for our Corporation. Plz provide in the coming release. Thanking you. ,I'm finding using the Clean button with Data.com also doesn't fire the territory reassignment.  Perhaps this is the root issue as well?,Berry Berry Important feature..... :),Please fix
Opportunity Products record types,Ron DiNardo,Under Consideration,6390,16,Hi Mark- I have checked with Product Management and unfortunately this is still not on our roadmap. ,This is a must have, please make record types available on opportunity products! ,None,We need this now! Please SFDC fix this!,None,I can't believe this is not available Salesforce please sort this.,We need this functionality as we have different opportunity record types (totally separate business models) with different opportunity line items - it does not make sense to show all fields.,This is desperately needed! I have had to create a custom object to overcome this but that has limitations interms of forecasting how we want! Please get this sorted, it would make life so much easier!,This is absolutely necessary! We have different areas and  the products need different specifications at the line item for each them.,This would be a great feature and much needed asap.,This is absolutely necessary! WE have sales reps selling different products/services for two different companies. Each has it's own opportunity record type and thes eproducts have very different specifications at the line item. Makes no sense why this is not already possible?,None,We need this functionality. We need to make some Opportunity Product fields mandatory for some products, and not others. The fact that we can create separate page layouts for Opportunity Products is great, but limited in its usefulness if we can only assign these layouts by user profile. All of our sales team share the same profile, but need to be able to enter different information for the different types of products they sell. ,I can't believe this is not available Salesforce please sort this.,None,This would definitely help our Business.
Allow Lightning for Outlook add-in to use the default browser when opening links,Jon Schantz,Under Point Threshold,1360,15,None,None,Agreed major flaw!,I agree @Dan Brazil! Why direct us to IE, when Lightning doesn't work there? This is one of the biggest errors I've seen from Salesforce in a while. Please fix immediately!,"This problem with the ""Ltng for Outlook"" button for ""Show the Salesforce Home Page"" only opening in Internet Explorer should be moved to a ""Known Issueinstead of an Idea.Our users",like many other,have moved to Lightning and should not be using IE per salesforce directives.,If you can't use Lightning with IE11, then why force the user to open links in that browser? Surely this is a bug... and a very drustrating usability issue at that.,This should not be an idea but a bug. We are on Lightning UI and IE is not  supported for Liughtning. SF please resolve the bug. ,Yes!!!,Has anyone found a solution for this? Not only does it open in IE, but IE refuses to remember the username and passwords, making it so that you have to log in everytime you want to see a record. ,This is really a must have - please prioritize.  There's got to be a windows registry hack of some sort to chnage this!! ,This is a must have.,@Adam Lederman - our team is working on extending IE11 support until a fix can be found for the default brower pop-out. ,Yes!!  I never use IE.  Would much prefer Chrome.,None,Would love to be able to switch the browser on this.
Collaborative Forecast (reports and filters on Forecast tab),Larry Tung,Under Point Threshold,1100,16,@Koinonia - what field indicated if something is a renewal?  Is it on the Product or the Opportunity?,being able to filter by product family or omit certain product families alltogether from the forecast would be ideal,Would love to filter this by product family - either by the amounts on the product line items themselves, or using the rollup fields we created at the opportunity level.  Each opp has an amount for product, maintenance, and services.  I'd love to have a separate forecast for each of these, in addition to the total amount that we can currently forecast on.,We need to further filter the function in order for forecast category to be able to clearly display the breakdown of figures. Currently this function is limited. We need filters to be able to use this function more appropriately.,As a sales org, we scrapped this as the functionality was too rigid to be useful.  Great idea, too bad it assumed that all instances were the same.,Need to be able to apply filter criteria to exclude certain products from the forecast opportunities quantity.,None,The ability to filter would help many. We can always use forecast category - because setting it to omitted will remove them completely from the rollups. Having filters defined at the forecast type page itself (forecast setting), will address lot of use case. We can create multiple forecast types with associated filters and use forecast tab to the fullest extent. Also if we can have different quotas for each forecast type - that would be awesome. ,I need this ability.  We've been using FunnelSource instead but would love to move to this native functionality and are not sure we can without this.,This would be a great enhancment to be able to filter the Forecast based on Opportunity Type,We would also make use of this type of filter. Particularly on the Product Family forecast, there are only some products that we want to include, and they are already organized into Product Family. A filter on Opportunity Record Type would work for us just as well as Product Family would.,One way to exclude some opportunities from the Forecast tab is to get their Forecast Category automatically set to Omitted. You can do this with a workflow or process builder flow or Apex, whichever you prefer. ,Collaborative Forecasting is useless for our organziation as we use multiple opportunity types of which not all are associated with new sales revenue.  Without the ability to filter specific opportunity types, we are back to spreadsheets to forecast.,This is a block for us to be adopting the Colaborative Forecasts. Would love to have it!,Being able to filter out Renewal deals would be aawesome!,what's the point threshold needed to get this on the radar, Salesforce? Not being able to filter forecast based on oppty fields (eg renewal vs. new business) is crippling and otherwise very useful feature (forecasts) and rendering it useless!
Make Sales Path Available on Cases,Jon Larson,Under Point Threshold,550,8,A MUCH needed feature! Please push to production ASAP.,yes please, would appreciate this on cases. ,I don't understand why the path wouldn't be rolled out for all standard objects....especially if they follow a staging process?,Please add this feature! We love the idea of paths but the Case object is where i would use it,A much needed feature.,This is much needed and seems as if this was a miss in Spring 17 because the ability for custom objects to have custom paths, but not Cases seems like the cart before the horse.,They are both similar and different.  Ideally, Salesforce would enable it on all objects. or at least standard objects.,None
Ability to copy sections between page layouts,m1adm,Under Point Threshold,1060,15,This would be epic.,This is so important and would save hundreds of hours of time.,Yes please add it! Will save a lot of time when migrating Orgs or installing new packages for example,This would save so much time!  Just created a new object which has 50+ fields and needs to be added to 6 page layouts.  It would be great to have the ability to add to one layout," save as ""component"" as another suggested and add the page ""component"" in it's entirety to the other 5 layouts.",This would be fantastic!,Yes, this would save lots of time. There should be a default (master) layout option that simply leaves off any fields without permissions for a user type. ,Yes, please add this functionality!!,There are 10 layouts for Opportunity and now the requirement was to add a section to all the layouts which in turn consist of 11 custom fields. I'll have to work on all the layouts replicating the same thing. ,We should not have to wait 8 years for this.,I just had to update 15 opportunity page layouts with new fields that I created and this would've made it much easier.,Yes! This would be amazing.,It is possible to do using the Force.com IDE, however this would be much more efficient if we could use it in the vanilla layout editor. Two thumbs up my friend!,It is possible to do using the Force.com IDE, however this would be much more efficient if we could use it in the vanilla layout editor. Two thumbs up my friend!,This would save us a lot of time when we are making changes to muliple page layouts. In many situations we can't deploy the whole page layout so being able to do a piece of it would be wonderful!,This would be a significant time saver and ensure all are seeing the same fields/location.
Email sync to Salesforce - Select what to sync by Sender,Megan Blumenthal,Under Point Threshold,580,0
Display Pardot info in SFDC Dashboards,Stacey Cogswell,Under Point Threshold,960,15,None,Considering the underwhelming reporting capabilities of Pardot, I expected more out of SalesForce's ability to integrate during reporting,We need this!!,None,"Agree - so much for ""tight integration""",Not really integrated !  We need this functionality in Dashboards ASAP,Looking at the larger picture, we need to be able to access the data itself for the Pardot activities, not just a view of the data.  Additional analytics are needed on the data to provide better insight.  One aspect is summarizing all the activity about a provider (Pardot, CRM, etc.) to provide directional guidance to the people in the field.,Not really integrated until you can see the Big Picture!  We need this functionality in Dashboards ASAP,We really need this function.,I am surprised this hasn't been added, yet. Yes, Please!!,We need this!,This would be really powerful and make Pardot / Salesforce much more interesting to executive level people who use dashboards.,Excellent feature to have in Salesforce, please add!!, Need this 100%,It is essential for seamless integration
