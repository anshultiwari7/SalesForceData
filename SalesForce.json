You would need to click on each single Case number to actually find out what the case number refers to. Fine to manage if you have only a few records to follow, impossible if you are following dozens or hundreds of cases. So the online list is not practical to use for me in its current limited format.

As such, my recommendation for anyone who anticipates building a complex process is that they should write an Apex trigger instead, as you will then have full control as to the number of queries being performed.

You have to explicitly uncheck some boxes if you don't want that to happen, which makes much more sense.
